## Description

The **Scholar** Skeleton is an assembled package, including the [Grav CMS](http://github.com/getgrav/grav), the [Scholar Theme](https://github.com/OleVik/grav-theme-scholar), necessary plugins, and sample content. Once installed, you're ready to start using Scholar, an academic-focused theme, for publishing papers, articles, books, documentation, your resum√© or other content with Grav.

## Installation

Installing the Scholar Skeleton can be done by downloading the newest [release](https://github.com/OleVik/grav-skeleton-scholar/releases) and extracting it to your webserver. From there it should work without issue, given that Grav's [requirements](https://learn.getgrav.org/basics/requirements) are met and you've followed the [installation](https://learn.getgrav.org/basics/installation) instructions. The Admin-plugin is recommended for easy management and editing of content.

## Usage and Configuration

See the [theme's repository](https://github.com/OleVik/grav-theme-scholar/) for instruction and details.
