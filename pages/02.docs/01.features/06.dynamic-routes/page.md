title: Dynamic Routes
---

There are four types of routes used in the theme: Data, Embed, Print, and Search. Each creates a virtual Page that facilitates special functionality. Each route is suffixed to the page.

## Data

Delivers the current Page as a JSON-version (JavaScript Object Notation) with [Linked Data](https://json-ld.org/), for example [/docs/features/dynamic-routes/data](/docs/features/dynamic-routes/data).

## Embed

Delivers a HTML-version of just the content of the Page, for embedding in other systems or another Page, for example [/docs/features/dynamic-routes/embed](/docs/features/dynamic-routes/embed).

## Print

Loads the current Page with a special Print-stylesheet, making it easier to Print it to a PDF or elsewhere, for example [/docs/features/dynamic-routes/print](/docs/features/dynamic-routes/print).

### Search

Replaces the content of the Page with a Search-form, for example [/docs/features/dynamic-routes/search](/docs/features/dynamic-routes/search).
