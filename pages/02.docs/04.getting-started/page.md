title: Getting started
---

There are two easy ways to get started: Using the [Admin-plugin](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-admin) or installing the [Scholar-skeleton](https://github.com/OleVik/grav-skeleton-scholar). The theme is optimized for easy-use with the former, and the latter is ready-to-use and contains a variety of possible content.

Once installed, the theme behaves pretty much like all other themes. There are excellent resources available online for getting started Grav and with writing content, such as [Grav's Documentation](https://learn.getgrav.org/16/basics/basic-tutorial) and [Paul Hibbitt's Intro to Grav Video Series](https://learn.hibbittsdesign.org/intro-to-grav-video-series).
