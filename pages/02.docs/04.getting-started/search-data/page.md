title: Search data
---

The theme relies on the [Static Generator plugin](https://github.com/OleVik/grav-plugin-static-generator) for genering search data. Follow the [usage directions](https://github.com/OleVik/grav-plugin-static-generator#usage) in its repository to create the data.

Once you have search data available, the theme's search-field and search-Pages will be available. You can also choose a specific set of data for use for a certain set of Pages and subpages, for example by setting `
search: "user://data/persist/docs.js"` in your Page's FrontMatter. This path should resolve to a file generated by the Static Generator plugin.
