indications upon the stick. It gives us the basis for several
deductions.

Has anything escaped me? I asked with some self-importance. I
trust that there is nothing of consequence which I have overlooked?

I am afraid, my dear Watson, that most of your conclusions were
erroneous. When I said that you stimulated me I meant, to be frank, that
in noting your fallacies I was occasionally guided towards the truth.
Not that you are entirely wrong in this instance. The man is certainly a
country practitioner. And he walks a good deal.

Then I was right.

To that extent.

But that was all.

No, no, my dear Watson, not all -- by no means all. I would suggest,
for example, that a presentation to a doctor is more likely to come from
a hospital than from a hunt, and that when the initials 'C.C.' are
placed before that hospital the words 'Charing Cross' very naturally
suggest themselves.

You may be right.

The probability lies in that direction. And if we take this as a
working hypothesis we have a fresh basis from which to start our
