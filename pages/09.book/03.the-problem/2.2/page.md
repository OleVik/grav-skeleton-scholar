What is the Alley like?

There are two lines of old yew hedge, twelve feet high and
impenetrable. The walk in the centre is about eight feet across.

Is there anything between the hedges and the walk?

Yes, there is a strip of grass about six feet broad on either side.

I understand that the yew hedge is penetrated at one point by a
gate?

Yes, the wicket-gate which leads on to the moor.

Is there any other opening?

None.

So that to reach the Yew Alley one either has to come down it from the
house or else to enter it by the moor-gate?

There is an exit through a summer-house at the far end.

Had Sir Charles reached this?

No; he lay about fifty yards from it.

Now, tell me, Dr. Mortimer -- and this is important -- the marks which
you saw were on the path and not on the grass?

No marks could show on the grass.

Were they on the same side of the path as the moor-gate?

Yes; they were on the edge of the path on the same side as the
moor-gate.
