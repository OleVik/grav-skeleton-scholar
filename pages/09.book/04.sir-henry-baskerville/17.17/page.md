A lad of fourteen, with a bright, keen face, had obeyed the summons of
the manager. He stood now gazing with great reverence at the famous
detective.

Let me have the Hotel Directory, said Holmes. Thank you! Now,
Cartwright, there are the names of twenty-three hotels here, all in the
immediate neighbourhood of Charing Cross. Do you see?

Yes, sir.

You will visit each of these in turn.

Yes, sir.

You will begin in each case by giving the outside porter one shilling.
Here are twenty-three shillings.

Yes, sir.

You will tell him that you want to see the waste-paper of yesterday.
You will say that an important telegram has miscarried and that you are
looking for it. You understand?

Yes, sir.

But what you are really looking for is the centre page of the Times
with some holes cut in it with scissors. Here is a copy of the Times. It
is this page. You could easily recognize it, could you not?

Yes, sir.

In each case the outside porter will send for the hall porter, to whom
also you will give a shilling. Here are twenty-three shillings. You will
then learn in possibly twenty cases out of the twenty-three that the
waste of the day before has been burned
