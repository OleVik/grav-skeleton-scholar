his extraordinary activity and fear lest he should lose his footing in
the treacherous mire, when I heard the sound of steps, and turning round
found a woman near me upon the path. She had come from the direction in

the dip of the moor had hid her until she was quite close.

I could not doubt that this was the Miss Stapleton of whom I had been

she was darker than any brunette whom I have seen in England -- slim,
elegant, and tall. She had a proud, finely cut face, so regular that it
might have seemed impassive were it not for the sensitive mouth and the
beautiful dark, eager eyes. With her perfect figure and elegant dress
she was, indeed, a strange apparition upon a lonely moorland path. Her
eyes were on her brother as I turned, and then she quickened her pace
