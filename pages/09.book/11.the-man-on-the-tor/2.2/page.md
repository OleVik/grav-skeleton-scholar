sitting before a Remington typewriter, sprang up with a pleasant smile
of welcome. Her face fell, however, when she saw that I was a stranger,
and she sat down again and asked me the object of my visit.

The first impression left by Mrs. Lyons was one of extreme beauty. Her
eyes and hair were of the same rich hazel colour, and her cheeks, though
considerably freckled, were flushed with the exquisite bloom of the
brunette, the dainty pink which lurks at the heart of the sulphur rose.
Admiration was, I repeat, the first impression. But the second was
criticism. There was something subtly wrong with the face, some
coarseness of expression, some hardness, perhaps, of eye, some looseness
of lip which marred its perfect beauty. But these, of course, are
after-thoughts. At the moment I was simply conscious that I was in the
presence of a very handsome woman, and that she was asking me the
reasons for my visit. I had not quite understood until that instant how
delicate my mission was.

I have the pleasure, said I, of knowing your father. It was a
clumsy introduction, and the lady made me feel it.

There is nothing in common between my father and me, she said. I
owe him nothing, and his friends are not mine. If it were not for the
late Sir Charles Baskerville and some other kind hearts I might have
starved for all that my father cared.

It was about the late Sir Charles Baskerville that I have come here to
see you.

The freckles started out on the lady's face.

What can I tell you about him? she asked, and her fingers played
nervously over the stops of her typewriter.
