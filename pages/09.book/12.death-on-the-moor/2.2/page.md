when I see the stub of a cigarette marked Bradley, Oxford Street, I know
that my friend Watson is in the neighbourhood. You will see it there
beside the path. You threw it down, no doubt, at that supreme moment
when you charged into the empty hut.

Exactly.

I thought as much -- and knowing your admirable tenacity I was
convinced that you were sitting in ambush, a weapon within reach,
waiting for the tenant to return. So you actually thought that I was the
criminal?

I did not know who you were, but I was determined to find out.

Excellent, Watson! And how did you localize me? You saw me, perhaps,
on the night of the convict hunt, when I was so imprudent as to allow
the moon to rise behind me?

Yes, I saw you then.

And have no doubt searched all the huts until you came to this one?

No, your boy had been observed, and that gave me a guide where to
look.

The old gentleman with the telescope, no doubt. I could not make it
out when first I saw the light flashing upon the lens. He rose and
peeped into the hut. Ha, I see that Cartwright has brought up some
supplies. What's this paper? So you have been to Coombe Tracey, have
you?

Yes.
