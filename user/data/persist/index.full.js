For example, if you wanted to not itemize paragraphs, figures, and images, you would set `theme: itemize: false`.\n\n## Customizing the options\n\nAll possible options are available in [basic.yaml](https:\/\/github.com\/OleVik\/grav-theme-scholar\/blob\/master\/blueprints\/partials\/basic.yaml), [advanced.yaml](https:\/\/github.com\/OleVik\/grav-theme-scholar\/blob\/master\/blueprints\/partials\/advanced.yaml), and [expert.yaml](https:\/\/github.com\/OleVik\/grav-theme-scholar\/blob\/master\/blueprints\/partials\/expert.yaml), and will by default be editable in the Admin-interface in the theme's options. If you are familiar with [Grav's blueprints](https:\/\/learn.getgrav.org\/16\/forms\/blueprints), you will notice that [this theme's fields](https:\/\/github.com\/OleVik\/grav-theme-scholar\/blob\/master\/blueprints.yaml) are set dynamically:\n\n```yaml\ndata-fields@:\n  [\n    '\\Grav\\Theme\\Scholar::getConfigBlueprintFields',\n    \"user:\/\/themes\/scholar\/blueprints\/partials\/basic.yaml\",\n  ]\nadvanced:\ntype: tab\ntitle: PLUGIN_ADMIN.ADVANCED\ndata-fields@:\n  [\n    '\\Grav\\Theme\\Scholar::getConfigBlueprintFields',\n    \"user:\/\/themes\/scholar\/blueprints\/partials\/advanced.yaml\",\n  ]\nexpert:\ntype: tab\ntitle: PLUGIN_ADMIN.EXPERT\ndata-fields@:\n  [\n    '\\Grav\\Theme\\Scholar::getConfigBlueprintFields',\n    \"user:\/\/themes\/scholar\/blueprints\/partials\/expert.yaml\",\n  ]\n```\n\nYour own, custom [child-theme](https:\/\/learn.getgrav.org\/16\/themes\/customization#theme-inheritance) can integrate any of these options as you see fit.\n\n## Customizing the blueprints\n\nThe helper-method `getConfigBlueprintFields()` lets you load a blueprint-file from a given path. It can also take a `prefix`-parameter, so you can use these options as you wish in other blueprints. For example, if you want to expose all the theme's options to each Page, you could change [\/blueprints\/default.yaml](https:\/\/github.com\/OleVik\/grav-theme-scholar\/blob\/master\/blueprints\/default.yaml) to:\n\n\n```yaml\ntitle: Scholar Options\nextends@:\n  type: default\n  context: blueprints:\/\/pages\n\nform:\n  fields:\n    tabs:\n      type: tabs\n      fields:\n        options:\n          type: tab\n          fields:\n            scholar_basic:\n              type: section\n              title: THEME_SCHOLAR.ADMIN.TITLES.BASIC\n              underline: true\n              data-fields@:\n                [\n                  '\\Grav\\Theme\\Scholar::getConfigBlueprintFields',\n                  \"theme:\/\/blueprints\/partials\/basic.yaml\",\n                  \"header.theme.\",\n                ]\n        advanced:\n          type: tab\n          fields:\n            scholar_advanced:\n              type: section\n              title: THEME_SCHOLAR.ADMIN.TITLES.ADVANCED\n              underline: true\n              data-fields@:\n                [\n                  '\\Grav\\Theme\\Scholar::getConfigBlueprintFields',\n                  \"theme:\/\/blueprints\/partials\/advanced.yaml\",\n                  \"header.theme.\",\n                ]\n            scholar_expert:\n              type: section\n              title: THEME_SCHOLAR.ADMIN.TITLES.EXPERT\n              underline: true\n              data-fields@:\n                [\n                  '\\Grav\\Theme\\Scholar::getConfigBlueprintFields',\n                  \"theme:\/\/blueprints\/partials\/expert.yaml\",\n                  \"header.theme.\",\n                ]\n```\n\nYou can also override and customize all blueprints as needed, as this [example in Grav's docs](https:\/\/learn.getgrav.org\/16\/forms\/blueprints\/example-config-blueprints) show.\n"},{"title":"Expert","date":"2019-12-24T19:14:37+00:00","url":"http:\/\/localhost\/docs\/configuration\/expert","taxonomy":{"categories":[],"tags":[]},"content":"## API (object)\n\nDefault:\n\n```yaml\ncontent: 'Content\\Content'\nlinked_data:\n  default: 'LinkedData\\PageLinkedData'\n  cv: 'LinkedData\\CVLinkedData'\nrouter: 'Router\\Router'\nsource: 'Source\\Source'\ntaxonomy_map: 'TaxonomyMap\\TaxonomyMap'\n```\n\nClasses used by API, all namedspaced to `Grav\\Theme\\Scholar`.\n\n### Content (string)\n\nClass used for manipulating HTML, largely static methods.\n\n### Linked Data (object)\n\nClass used for generating [Linked Data](https:\/\/json-ld.org\/).\n\n#### Default (string)\n\nDefault class used for generating Linked Data.\n\n#### CV (string)\n\nClass used for generating Linked Data for the CV Page Type.\n\n### Router (string)\n\nClass used for dynamic routes, that lets the theme handle the rendering of content in certain suffixed URLs.\n\n### Source (string)\n\nHelper-class used for parsing and cleaning Media-paths in a Page.\n\n### Taxonomy Map (string)\n\nHelper-class for generating a structured mapping of the Taxonomy used on a site, and the taxonomical items therein.\n"},{"title":"Advanced","date":"2019-12-24T12:13:32+00:00","url":"http:\/\/localhost\/docs\/configuration\/advanced","taxonomy":{"categories":[],"tags":[]},"content":"## Components (array)\n\nDefault:\n\n```yaml\n- blog\n- book\n- cv\n- docs\n- tufte\n```\n\nEnables components from `\/components`.\n\n## Router (boolean)\n\nDefault: `true`, enables dynamic routing. `false` disables it.

are Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) that stylize all aspects of the basic structure of the Scholar-theme. They are, however, not defined within Components, but rather in CSS-files available to the theme itself. This is to reduce the typical overhead of loading more files with each Page.\n\nStyles follow a basic principle: They should only apply color, fonts, or other rules that accentuate elements. The basic structure and layout of each Page is governed by the theme itself. This makes it easy to use the theme as a base for creating your own Style, as `\/css\/theme.css` will structure each Page uniformly with the default styles set by the browser.\n\nYou can set the type of Style to use on any specific Page, by using the `theme`-property in the Page's FrontMatter:\n\n```yaml\ntheme:\n  style: metal\n```\n\nSo if you wanted to use the Berlin Style for a Page, you would set `theme: style: berlin`. This option also cascades from top-level Pages to lower-level Pages. For example, if the Docs Page sets a specific Style in it's FrontMatter, all descendant Pages will use the same Style, unless any specific Page sets its own Style to use.\n\nThe default theme is named _Metal_, and looks like this:\n\n## Metal\n\n### Index\n\n![Body](image:\/\/styles.spec.js\/metal\/index\/body.png)\n\n### Article\n\n![Body](image:\/\/styles.spec.js\/metal\/article\/body.png)\n\n### Blog\n\n![Body](image:\/\/styles.spec.js\/metal\/blog\/body.png)\n\n### CV\n\n![Body](image:\/\/styles.spec.js\/metal\/cv\/body.png)\n\n### Docs\n\n![Body](image:\/\/styles.spec.js\/metal\/docs\/body.png)\n"},{"title":"Dynamic Routes","date":"2019-12-27T15:08:02+00:00","url":"http:\/\/localhost\/docs\/features\/dynamic-routes","taxonomy":{"categories":[],"tags":[]},"content":"There are four types of routes used in the theme: Data, Embed, Print, and Search.

The most important thing you can do to improve the speed of Grav is to run a modern version of PHP, on a server with solid-state drives. To improve the speed of the theme, make sure the site runs over HTTPS and uses the [HTTP\/2 protocol](https:\/\/developers.google.com\/web\/fundamentals\/performance\/http2) - this massively improves how fast assets are downloaded. Finally, consider using a [content delivery network and load-balancer](https:\/\/support.cloudflare.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/205177068-How-does-Cloudflare-work-).\n\nEven without optimization beyond Grav's default file caching, the above improvements should have the website load in some hundreds of milliseconds. A guide on achieving close to 100% score in PageRank and YSlow can be [found online](https:\/\/olevik.me\/writing\/code\/optimizing-a-grav-installation).\n"},{"title":"Landmarks","date":"2019-12-25T16:20:55+00:00","url":"http:\/\/localhost\/docs\/features\/accessibility\/landmarks","taxonomy":{"categories":[],"tags":[]},"content":"Following the [principles of HTML5](https:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/wai-aria-practices\/examples\/landmarks\/index.html), a handful of high-level HTML-elements are used for [sectioning](https:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/wai-aria-practices\/examples\/landmarks\/HTML5.html) documents. This simplifies accessible access to each Page, by leveraging [Accessible Rich Internet Applications](https:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/WCAG20-TECHS\/aria#ARIA11) (ARIA).\n\n## Examples from Page Types\n\nBecause of how templates are structured, they all implement pretty much the same landmarks for consistency. Below are some examples of how Components and some notable landmarks look with the default Style applied.\n\n### Index\n\n#### Body\n\n![Body](image:\/\/components.spec.js\/index\/body.png)\n\n#### Header\n\n![Header](image:\/\/components.spec.js\/index\/header.png)\n\n#### Main > Article\n\n![Main > Article](image:\/\/components.spec.js\/index\/main-article.png)\n\n#### Sidebar > Article\n\n![Sidebar > Article](image:\/\/components.spec.js\/index\/sidebar-article.png)\n\n#### Sidebar > Header\n\n![Sidebar > Header](image:\/\/components.spec.js\/index\/sidebar-header.png)\n\n### Article\n\n#### Body\n\n![Body](image:\/\/components.spec.js\/article\/body.png)\n\n### Blog\n\n#### Body\n\n![Body](image:\/\/components.spec.js\/blog\/body.png)\n\n### CV\n\n#### Body\n\n![Body](image:\/\/components.spec.js\/cv\/body.png)\n\n### Docs\n\n#### Body\n\n![Body](image:\/\/components.spec.js\/docs\/body.png)\n\n#### Header\n\n![Header](image:\/\/components.spec.js\/docs\/header.png)\n\n#### Main > Article\n\n![Article](image:\/\/components.spec.js\/docs\/main-article.png)\n\n#### Sidebar\n\n![Sidebar](image:\/\/components.spec.js\/docs\/sidebar.png)\n"},{"title":"Accessibility","date":"2019-12-27T14:47:13+00:00","url":"http:\/\/localhost\/docs\/features\/accessibility","taxonomy":{"categories":[],"tags":[]},"content":"The theme is written with accessibility in mind from the ground up; it uses semantic [landmarks](landmarks), ARIA-roles and -properties, as well as keyboard-navigation and event handlers for interaction. This ensures that the website can be navigated using a keyboard with ease, and also through screen readers. The approach of progressive enhancement is aimed at making the theme apt for a wide audience.\n\n## Supported browsers\n\nBoth the CSS and JS used in the theme are compiled against [Browserslist](https:\/\/github.com\/browserslist\/browserslist#best-practices) \"default\" [query](https:\/\/browserl.ist\/?q=defaults). Simply put, this includes browsers that have more than 0.5% market coverage, including their last two versions, Firefox Extended Support Release, and that are not considered dead - that is, not receiving updates from its vendor or author anymore. At the end of December 2019, this means a browser-coverage of 91.34%.\n\nThis also means that certain infamous browsers, like Internet Explorer version 5.5-10 is not supported. Nor is its newest version, 11, particularly paid attention to. The main focus is supporting [\"Evergreen browsers\"](https:\/\/learn-the-web.algonquindesign.ca\/topics\/browser-testing\/#evergreen-browsers), which update themselves regularly and thus support and follow modern standards, specifications, and features.\n\n## Testing\n\nThe end-to-end testing runner [Cypress](https:\/\/www.cypress.io\/) is used for testing Components against [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https:\/\/www.deque.com\/wcag\/) level A, [Section 508](https:\/\/www.deque.com\/section-508-compliance\/) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and Best Practices in [Axe Core](https:\/\/github.com\/dequelabs\/axe-core).\n\nThis automates testing of ARIA compliance, necessary contrast for all Styles, that elements can be interacted with, and that tabbing behavior follows the expected logic. All responsive breakpoints, landmarks, and Styles are also tested and inspected for correct behavior.\n"},{"title":"Layouts","date":"2019-12-25T18:05:37+00:00","url":"http:\/\/localhost\/docs\/features\/layouts","taxonomy":{"categories":[],"tags":[]},"content":"_Layouts_ are templates that achieve a specific appearance through HTML-structures and CSS-styling, and more broadly are subservient to Components.

Each Layout is also not dependant on a Style - its basic structure is defined apart from the Style, so you can rapidly bootstrap a new look for it.\n\n## Examples of responsive behavior\n\nThe theme follows the \"mobile first\" methodology to scale the layouts up for higher viewport widths.

Like other components, the Book-template will be at the top of the hierarchy of Pages. Following that, you can group chapters in their own folders and use the Chapter-template, and below that each Page will have its own folder and use the Page-template.\n\n## An example\n\nThe [sample Book](https:\/\/github.com\/OleVik\/grav-skeleton-scholar\/tree\/master\/user\/pages\/07.book), \"The Hound of the Baskervilles\" by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, has the following structure:\n\n```\nuser\/pages\/07.book\n|   book.md\n|   cover.jpg\n|\n+---01.mr-sherlock-holmes\n|   |   chapter.md\n|   |\n|   +---1.1\n|   |       page.md\n|   |\n|   +---2.2\n|   |       page.md\n|   |\n|   +---3.3\n|   |       page.md\n|   |\n|   +---4.4\n|   |       page.md\n|   |\n|   +---5.5\n|   |       page.md\n|   |\n|   +---6.6\n|   |       page.md\n|   |\n|   +---7.7\n|   |       page.md\n|   |\n|   +---8.8\n|   |       page.md\n|   |\n|   \\---9.9\n|           page.md\n...\n```\n\nBoth the Book and Chapter can use the `subtitle`-property, but otherwise requires very little metadata in the FrontMatter. Pages will be grouped and rendered by the templates. Only the `book.md`- and `chapter.md`-files need to contain FrontMatter, all `page.md`-files can only Markdown, as the Page-number within the Chapter will be used as the title.\n\n## Ordering Pages in the Book\n\nIt is important that you explicitly change how Pages should be ordered, if you are not utilising [Grav's natural ordering](https:\/\/learn.getgrav.org\/16\/content\/content-pages#folders). This looks at the folder-names and checks whether any integer follow by a period, eg. `01.folder-name`, is used. This is a simple way to ensure that Chapters and Pages appear in the order you expect them to. But there are many other [ordering options](https:\/\/learn.getgrav.org\/16\/content\/collections#ordering-options) that can be used, just pass the parameters in the FrontMatter:\n\n```yaml\ncontent:\n  order:\n    by: folder\n    dir: asc\n```\n\n## Book Cover\n\nBy setting the `image`-property in the FrontMatter, you can link to an image to display as the Book Cover. You can also assign taxonomies as usual, and specify a print-logic for the special `\/print`-route.\n\n```yaml\ntitle: \"The Hound of the Baskervilles\"\nmenu: \"Book\"\nimage: \"cover.jpg\"\ntaxonomy:\n  categories: fiction\n  tags: [book]\n  author:\n    - name: \"Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\"\n      affiliation: \"Farkas Translations, ManyBooks.net\"\nprint:\n  items: \"@self.descendants\"\n  order:\n    by: 'folder'\n    dir: 'asc'\n  process: true\n```\n\n![Index](image:\/\/breakpoints.spec.js\/992\/book.png)\n"},{"title":"Index","date":"2019-12-27T17:24:26+00:00","url":"http:\/\/localhost\/docs\/features\/components\/index","taxonomy":{"categories":[],"tags":[]},"content":"The _Index_ Component displays one to two [collections of Pages](https:\/\/learn.getgrav.org\/16\/content\/collections), the first one primary and the second complementary.

These are templates that each Page can use, and the core types include:\n\n- Default: A generic type\n- Index: A type for displaying a collection of Pages\n- Article: A template for an article, a paper, a document, or a similar type of standalone piece of writing\n- Page: A generic type which extends the topmost parent's template\n- Print: A helper-type for adopting the rendering for printing\n- Search: A helper-type which extends the topmost parent's template and implements search-fields\n\nThe modular types include:\n\n- Blog: A replica of `Index`, but includes the `blog`-class for styling-differences\n- Post: A subset of `Default`, but includes the option for a hero-image\n- Book: A type for rendering a collections of Pages, with rendering optimized for a book's contents\n- Chapter: A replica of `Page`, used for organization of Pages\n- CV: A type for rendering a standalone resum\u00e9\n- Docs: A type for rendering Documentation Pages\n- Sequence: An experimentational type for rendering a structured diagram of Pages\n- Tufte: A subset of `Article`, optimized for [Tufte Handouts](https:\/\/edwardtufte.github.io\/tufte-css\/)\n\n## Components and Page Types\n\nThe theme is stricter than most themes in how the Pages and Page Types must be structured. The theme expects Page Types to be declared as high-level structures, with lower-level structures beneath. For example, for a set of Documentation Pages, `docs.html.twig` would be the uppermost template. Below there will be hierarchical folders of Pages, using `page.html.twig` for each.\n\nThe theme uses modular components to let you choose what features you want. These are not the same as as [Modular Pages](https:\/\/learn.getgrav.org\/16\/content\/modular) in Grav. The `components`-setting in the theme's configuration-file is a plain list of names of Components to load.\n\nEach Component exists in the `\/components`-folder, and contains needed templates, a schema, and assets needed to render it. Extensions to the theme, or child-themes, can deliver their own Components by replicating this structure or overriding the existing structure. For example, the Tufte-article looks like this, in `\/components\/tufte`:\n\n```\n\u2502  schema.yaml\n\u2502  tufte.html.twig\n\u251c\u2500\u2500assets\/\n\u2502    tufte.min.css\n\u251c\u2500\u2500partials\/\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500tufte\n\u2502        note.html.twig\n\u2514\u2500\u2500shortcodes\/\n      CiteShortcode.php\n      NoteShortcode.php\n```\n\nWherein `schema.yaml` holds basic data used for Linked Data and ARIA-attributes:\n\n```yaml\ntufte:\n  name: tufte\n  schema: ScholarlyArticle\n```\n\n`tufte.html.twig` defines how a `tufte.md`-file is rendered, `\/components\/tufte\/assets` holds the necessary style in `tufte.min.css`, `\/components\/tufte\/partials` holds template-pieces specific to this template, and `\/components\/tufte\/shortcodes` the shortcodes that can be used in `tufte.md`.\n"},{"title":"Features","date":"2019-12-24T12:54:55+00:00","url":"http:\/\/localhost\/docs\/features","taxonomy":{"categories":[],"tags":[]},"content":"- Extensible Components, Layouts and template-partials, Styles, API\n- Responsive Layouts, multiple Styles\n  - Print-friendly styles\n- Performant, light on resources\n- Accessible, tested against WCAG AA, Section 508, and best practices\n  - Navigable by keyboard and screen readers\n  - Readable contrast across Styles\n  - Clean, declarative HTML-structure with semantic labels\n- Automated Evergreen-browser compatibility\n- Compatible with a static setup\n- Dynamic functionality for Data, Embed, Print, and Search Pages\n"},{"title":"Installation","date":"2019-12-24T12:02:29+00:00","url":"http:\/\/localhost\/docs\/installation","taxonomy":{"categories":[],"tags":[]},"content":"The only necessary requirements for the theme are the basic [Grav requirements](http:\/\/learn.getgrav.org\/basics\/requirements).

It reached the baronet, and\ngave him the first warning of his danger.\n\nIt was very essential for Stapleton to get some article of Sir\nHenry's attire so that, in case he was driven to use the dog, he might\nalways have the means of setting him upon his track.

You perceive the\ndevilish cunning of it, for really it would be almost impossible to make\na case against the real murderer. His only accomplice was one who could\nnever give him away, and the grotesque, inconceivable nature of the\ndevice only served to make it more effective. Both of the women\nconcerned in the case, Mrs. Stapleton and Mrs. Laura Lyons, were left\nwith a strong suspicion against Stapleton. Mrs. Stapleton knew that he\nhad designs upon the old man, and also of the existence of the hound.\nMrs. Lyons knew neither of these things, but had been impressed by the\ndeath occurring at the time of an uncancelled appointment which was only\nknown to him. However, both of them were under his influence, and he had\nnothing to fear from them. The first half of his task was successfully\naccomplished but the more difficult still remained.\n\nIt is possible that Stapleton did not know of the existence of an heir\nin Canada. In any case he would very soon learn it from his friend Dr.\nMortimer, and he was told by the latter all details about the arrival of\nHenry Baskerville. Stapleton's first idea was that this young stranger\nfrom Canada might possibly be done to death in London without coming\ndown to Devonshire at all. He distrusted his wife ever since she had\nrefused to help him in laying a trap for the old man, and he dared not\nleave her long out of his sight for fear he should lose his influence\nover her. It was for this reason that he took her to London with him.\nThey lodged, I find, at the Mexborough Private Hotel, in Craven Street,\nwhich was actually one of those called upon by my agent in search of\nevidence.

He\nmust act at once, or his victim might get beyond his power. He therefore\nput pressure upon Mrs. Lyons to write this letter, imploring the old man\nto give her an interview on the evening before his departure for London.\nHe then, by a specious argument, prevented her from going, and so had\nthe chance for which he had waited.\n\nDriving back in the evening from Coombe Tracey he was in time to get\nhis hound, to treat it with his infernal paint, and to bring the beast\nround to the gate at which he had reason to expect that he would find\nthe old gentleman waiting. The dog, incited by its master, sprang over\nthe wicket-gate and pursued the unfortunate baronet, who fled screaming\ndown the Yew Alley. In that gloomy tunnel it must indeed have been a\ndreadful sight to see that huge black creature, with its flaming jaws\nand blazing eyes, bounding after its victim. He fell dead at the end of\nthe alley from heart disease and terror. The hound had kept upon the\ngrassy border while the baronet had run down the path, so that no track\nbut the man's was visible. On seeing him lying still the creature had\nprobably approached to sniff at him, but finding him dead had turned\naway again. It was then that it left the print which was actually\nobserved by Dr. Mortimer.

When\nhe went to Devonshire his plans were, I believe, exceedingly hazy, but\nthat he meant mischief from the first is evident from the way in which\nhe took his wife with him in the character of his sister.

One word now as to how I stood myself at\nthat time. It may possibly recur to your memory that when I examined the\npaper upon which the printed words were fastened I made a close\ninspection for the water-mark.

Thus\nI had made certain of the hound, and had guessed at the criminal before\never we went to the west country.\n\nIt was my game to watch Stapleton. It was evident, however, that I\ncould not do this if I were with you, since he would be keenly on his\nguard. I deceived everybody, therefore, yourself included, and I came\ndown secretly when I was supposed to be in London. My hardships were not\nso great as you imagined, though such trifling details must never\ninterfere with the investigation of a case. I stayed for the most part\nat Coombe Tracey, and only used the hut upon the moor when it was\nnecessary to be near the scene of action.

There can be no question that Stapleton had a confidant,\nthough it is unlikely that he ever placed himself in his power by\nsharing all his plans with him. There was an old manservant at Merripit\nHouse, whose name was Anthony.

In my last report I ended upon my top note with Barrymore at\nthe window, and now I have quite a budget already which will, unless I\nam much mistaken, considerably surprise you.

The western window through which he had stared so intently has,\nI noticed, one peculiarity above all other windows in the house -- it\ncommands the nearest outlook on the moor. There is an opening between\ntwo trees which enables one from this point of view to look right down\nupon it, while from all the other windows it is only a distant glimpse\nwhich can be obtained. It follows, therefore, that Barrymore, since only\nthis window would serve the purpose, must have been looking out for\nsomething or somebody upon the moor. The night was very dark, so that I\ncan hardly imagine how he could have hoped to see anyone. It had struck\nme that it was possible that some love intrigue was on foot. That would\nhave accounted for his stealthy movements and also for the uneasiness of\nhis wife.

We were only doing\nour duty in taking this chance of putting him back where he could do no\nharm. With his brutal and violent nature, others would have to pay the\nprice if we held our hands.

The longer one stays here the more does the spirit\nof the moor sink into one's soul, its vastness, and also its grim\ncharm. When you are once out upon its bosom you have left all traces of\nmodern England behind you, but on the other hand you are conscious\neverywhere of the homes and the work of the prehistoric people. On all\nsides of you as you walk are the houses of these forgotten folk, with\ntheir graves and the huge monoliths which are supposed to have marked\ntheir temples. As you look at their gray stone huts against the scarred\nhill-sides you leave your own age behind you, and if you were to see a\nskin-clad, hairy man crawl out from the low door fitting a flint-tipped\narrow on to the string of his bow, you would feel that his presence\nthere was more natural than your own. The strange thing is that they\nshould have lived so thickly on what must always have been most\nunfruitful soil. I am no antiquarian, but I could imagine that they were\nsome unwarlike and harried race who were forced to accept that which\nnone other would occupy.\n\nAll this, however, is foreign to the mission on which you sent me and\nwill probably be very uninteresting to your severely practical mind. I\ncan still remember your complete indifference\n"},{"title":"5","date":"2019-08-06T14:08:37+00:00","url":"http:\/\/localhost\/book\/first-report-of-dr-watson\/5","taxonomy":{"categories":[],"tags":[]},"content":"families had suffered from some evil influence, and he left us with the\nimpression that he shared the popular view upon the matter.\n\nOn our way back we stayed for lunch at Merripit House, and it was there\nthat Sir Henry made the acquaintance of Miss Stapleton.\n\n\\> From the first moment that he saw her he appeared to be strongly\nattracted by her, and I am much mistaken if the feeling was not mutual.\nHe referred to her again and again on our walk home, and since then\nhardly a day has passed that we have not seen something of the brother\nand sister.

One would imagine that such a match would be very\nwelcome to Stapleton, and yet I have more than once caught a look of the\nstrongest disapprobation in his face when Sir Henry has been paying some\nattention to his sister. He is much attached to her, no doubt, and would\nlead a lonely life without her, but it would seem the height of\nselfishness if he were to stand in the way of her making so brilliant a\nmarriage.

It was thrown by a man who walked softly down the passage\nwith a candle held in his hand. He was in shirt and trousers, with no\ncovering to his feet. I could merely see the outline, but his height\ntold me that it was Barrymore. He walked very slowly and circumspectly,\nand there was something indescribably guilty and furtive in his whole\nappearance.\n\nI have told you that the corridor is broken by the balcony which runs\nround the hall, but that it is resumed upon the farther side. I waited\nuntil he had passed out of sight and then I followed him. When I came\nround the balcony he had reached the end of the farther corridor, and I\ncould see from the glimmer of light through an open door that he had\nentered one of the rooms. Now, all these rooms are unfurnished and\nunoccupied, so that his expedition became more mysterious than ever. The\nlight shone steadily as if he were standing motionless. I crept down the\npassage as noiselessly as I could and peeped round the corner of the\ndoor.\n\nBarrymore was crouching at the window with the candle held against the\nglass. His profile was half turned towards me, and his face seemed to be\nrigid with expectation as he stared out into the blackness of the moor.\nFor some minutes he stood watching intently. Then he gave a deep groan\nand with an impatient gesture he put out the light.

There is strong reason now to believe that he has\ngot right away, which is a considerable relief to the lonely\nhouseholders of this district. A fortnight has passed since his flight,\nduring which he has not been seen and nothing has been heard of him. It\nis surely inconceivable that he could have held out upon the moor during\nall that time. Of course, so far as his concealment goes there is no\ndifficulty at all. Any one of these stone huts would give him a\nhiding-place. But there is nothing to eat unless he were to catch and\nslaughter one of the moor sheep. We think, therefore, that he has gone,\nand the outlying farmers sleep the better in consequence.\n\nWe are four able-bodied men in this household, so that we could take\ngood care of ourselves, but I confess that I have had uneasy moments\nwhen I have thought of the Stapletons.

They would be helpless in the hands of a\ndesperate fellow like this Notting Hill criminal, if he could once\neffect an entrance.

It was a sweet,\nsimple country spot, but I was surprised to observe that by the gate\nthere stood two soldierly men in dark uniforms, who leaned upon their\nshort rifles and glanced keenly at us as we passed. The coachman, a\nhard-faced, gnarled little fellow, saluted Sir Henry Baskerville, and in\na few minutes we were flying swiftly down the broad, white road. Rolling\npasture lands curved upward on either side of us, and old gabled houses\npeeped out from amid the thick green foliage, but behind the peaceful\nand sunlit country-side there rose ever, dark against the evening sky,\nthe long, gloomy curve of the moor, broken by the jagged and sinister\nhills.\n\nThe wagonette swung round into a side road, and we curved upward through\ndeep lanes worn by centuries of wheels, high banks on either side, heavy\nwith dripping moss and fleshy hart's-tongue ferns. Bronzing bracken and\nmottled bramble gleamed in the light of the sinking sun. Still steadily\nrising, we passed over a narrow granite bridge, and skirted a noisy\nstream which gushed swiftly down, foaming and roaring amid the gray\nboulders. Both road and stream wound up through a valley dense with\nscrub oak and fir. At every turn Baskerville gave an exclamation of\ndelight, looking eagerly about him and asking countless questions. To\nhis eyes all seemed beautiful, but to me a tinge of melancholy lay upon\nthe country-side, which bore so clearly the mark of the waning year.\nYellow leaves carpeted the lanes and fluttered down upon us as we\npassed.

But\nyou were very young when you last saw Baskerville Hall, were you not?\n\nI was a boy in my 'teens at the time of my father's death, and had\nnever seen the Hall, for he lived in a little cottage on the South\nCoast. Thence I went straight to a friend in America. I tell you it is\nall as new to me as it is to Dr. Watson, and I'm as keen as possible to\nsee the moor.\n\nAre you? Then your wish is easily granted, for there is your first\nsight of the moor, said Dr. Mortimer, pointing out of the carriage\nwindow.\n\nOver the green squares of the fields and the low curve of a wood there\nrose in the distance a gray, melancholy hill, with a strange jagged\nsummit, dim and vague in the distance, like some fantastic landscape in\na dream. Baskerville sat for a long time, his eyes fixed upon it, and I\nread upon his eager face how much it meant to him, this first sight of\nthat strange spot where the men of his blood had held sway so long and\nleft their mark so deep. There he sat, with his tweed suit and his\nAmerican accent, in the corner of a prosaic railway-carriage, and yet as\nI looked at his dark and expressive face I felt more than ever how true\na descendant he was of that long line of high-blooded, fiery, and\nmasterful men. There were pride, valour, and strength in his thick\nbrows, his sensitive nostrils, and his large hazel eyes. If on that\nforbidding moor a difficult and dangerous quest should lie before us,\nthis was at least a comrade for whom one might venture to take a risk\nwith the certainty that he would bravely share it.\n"},{"title":"3","date":"2019-08-06T14:08:57+00:00","url":"http:\/\/localhost\/book\/baskerville-hall\/3","taxonomy":{"categories":[],"tags":[]},"content":"about alone.

A lawyer, is he not, gray-headed, and walks with\na limp?\n\nNo, sir; this is Mr. Johnson, the coal-owner, a very active gentleman,\nnot older than yourself.\n\nSurely you are mistaken about his trade?\n\nNo, sir! he has used this hotel for many years, and he is very well\nknown to us.\n\nAh, that settles it.

You know my methods. Apply them!\n\nI can only think of the obvious conclusion that the man has practised\nin town before going to the country.\n\nI think that we might venture a little farther than this. Look at it\nin this light. On what occasion would it be most probable that such a\npresentation would be made? When would his friends unite to give him a\npledge of their good will? Obviously at the moment when Dr. Mortimer\nwithdrew from the service of the hospital in order to start in practice\nfor himself. We know there has been a presentation. We believe there has\nbeen a change from a town hospital to a country practice. Is it, then,\nstretching our inference too far to say that the presentation was on the\noccasion of the change?\n\nIt certainly seems probable.\n\nNow, you will observe that he could not have been on the staff of the\nhospital, since only a man well-established in a London practice could\nhold such a position, and such a one would not drift into the country.\nWhat was he, then? If he was in the hospital and yet not on the staff he\ncould only have been a house-surgeon or a house-physician -- little more\nthan a senior student. And he left five years ago -- the date is on the\nstick. So your grave, middle-aged family practitioner vanishes into thin\nair, my dear Watson, and there emerges a young fellow under thirty,\namiable, unambitious, absent-minded, and the possessor of a favourite\ndog, which I should describe roughly as being larger than a terrier and\nsmaller than a mastiff.\n"},{"title":"3","date":"2019-08-06T14:08:57+00:00","url":"http:\/\/localhost\/book\/mr-sherlock-holmes\/3","taxonomy":{"categories":[],"tags":[]},"content":"and carrying the cane to the window, he looked over it again with a\nconvex lens.\n\nInteresting, though elementary, said he as he returned to his\nfavourite corner of the settee.

I would suggest,\nfor example, that a presentation to a doctor is more likely to come from\na hospital than from a hunt, and that when the initials 'C.C.' are\nplaced before that hospital the words 'Charing Cross' very naturally\nsuggest themselves.\n\nYou may be right.\n\nThe probability lies in that direction.

The main theme of the works of Gibson is a subdialectic paradox. Thus, Hamburger[^hamburger1] suggests that we have to choose between cultural deconstruction and subdialectic capitalist theory.\n\n[^hamburger1]: Hamburger, W.

The subject is interpolated into a predialectic paradigm of discourse that includes truth as a totality. Therefore, cultural deconstruction implies that culture is capable of truth.\n\nIf neosemioticist libertarianism holds, we have to choose between cultural deconstruction and capitalist materialism.

O\u2019Reilly & Associates[\/sidenote] suggests that the works of Gibson are an example of self-sufficient socialism.\n\nDebord uses the term \u2018predialectic capitalist theory\u2019 to denote the role of the poet as reader. Thus, Lyotard\u2019s essay on prepatriarchialist nationalism states that art has intrinsic meaning.\n\n[marginnote]\n\n![_England under the House of Hanover; its history and condition during the reigns of the three Georges, illustrated from the caricatures and satires of the day ...

Fairholt.\")\n\n[\/marginnote]\n\nThe example of cultural deconstruction which is a central theme of Gibson\u2019s Virtual Light is also evident in All Tomorrow\u2019s Parties. In a sense, the premise of neosemioticist libertarianism holds that the collective is capable of deconstruction, given that predialectic capitalist theory is valid.\n\nThe subject is contextualised into a neosemioticist libertarianism that includes truth as a reality. However, Derrida\u2019s analysis of material discourse implies that reality comes from the masses.\n\n## Gibson and predialectic capitalist theory\n\nThe primary theme of Hamburger\u2019s[^hamburger2] model of neosemioticist libertarianism is not dematerialism, but predematerialism. Marx uses the term \u2018predialectic capitalist theory\u2019 to denote a mythopoetical whole. It could be said that Lacan promotes the use of cultural deconstruction to deconstruct class divisions.\n\n[^hamburger2]: Hamburger, B. F.

Contexts of genre\n\nIn the works of Gibson, a predominant concept is the concept of textual consciousness. The main theme of the works of Gibson is a subdialectic paradox. Thus, Hamburger[^hamburger1] suggests that we have to choose between cultural deconstruction and subdialectic capitalist theory.\n\n[^hamburger1]: Hamburger, W.

Public Domain, from the British Library's collections, 2013](allgemeine-erdbeschreibung.jpg \"Allgemeine Erdbeschreibung\")\n\n\u201cSociety is intrinsically dead,\u201d says Derrida. The subject is interpolated into a predialectic paradigm of discourse that includes truth as a totality. Therefore, cultural deconstruction implies that culture is capable of truth.\n\nIf neosemioticist libertarianism holds, we have to choose between cultural deconstruction and capitalist materialism. But d\u2019Erlette[sidenote]d\u2019Erlette, R. W. Z. ed. (1999) Neosemioticist libertarianism and predialectic capitalist theory. O\u2019Reilly & Associates[\/sidenote] suggests that the works of Gibson are an example of self-sufficient socialism.\n\nDebord uses the term \u2018predialectic capitalist theory\u2019 to denote the role of the poet as reader. Thus, Lyotard\u2019s essay on prepatriarchialist nationalism states that art has intrinsic meaning.\n\n[marginnote]\n\n![_England under the House of Hanover; its history and condition during the reigns of the three Georges, illustrated from the caricatures and satires of the day ...

With numerous illustrations executed by F. W. Fairholt.\")\n\n[\/marginnote]\n\nThe example of cultural deconstruction which is a central theme of Gibson\u2019s Virtual Light is also evident in All Tomorrow\u2019s Parties. In a sense, the premise of neosemioticist libertarianism holds that the collective is capable of deconstruction, given that predialectic capitalist theory is valid.\n\nThe subject is contextualised into a neosemioticist libertarianism that includes truth as a reality. However, Derrida\u2019s analysis of material discourse implies that reality comes from the masses.\n\n## 2. Gibson and predialectic capitalist theory\n\nThe primary theme of Hamburger\u2019s[^hamburger2] model of neosemioticist libertarianism is not dematerialism, but predematerialism. Marx uses the term \u2018predialectic capitalist theory\u2019 to denote a mythopoetical whole. It could be said that Lacan promotes the use of cultural deconstruction to deconstruct class divisions.\n\n[^hamburger2]: Hamburger, B. F.
