The _Blog_ Component basically does what the Index Component does, though without the logo. It's a separate template to make it easier to customize, and easier to organize. Similarly, the Post-template is made for writing Blog Posts, and features an optional `subtitle`-property and `image`-property in its FrontMatter.
