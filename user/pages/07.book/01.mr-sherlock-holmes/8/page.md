fissure? A cast of your skull, sir, until the original is available,
would be an ornament to any anthropological museum. It is not my
intention to be fulsome, but I confess that I covet your skull.

Sherlock Holmes waved our strange visitor into a chair. You are an
enthusiast in your line of thought, I perceive, sir, as I am in mine,
said he. I observe from your forefinger that you make your own
cigarettes. Have no hesitation in lighting one.

The man drew out paper and tobacco and twirled the one up in the other
with surprising dexterity. He had long, quivering fingers as agile and
restless as the antennae of an insect.

Holmes was silent, but his little darting glances showed me the interest
which he took in our curious companion.

I presume, sir, said he at last, that it was not merely for the
purpose of examining my skull that you have done me the honour to call
here last night and again to-day?

No, sir, no; though I am happy to have had the opportunity of doing
that as well. I came to you, Mr. Holmes, because I recognized that I am
myself an unpractical man and because I am suddenly confronted with a
most serious and extraordinary problem. Recognizing, as I do, that you
are the second highest expert in Europe \-\-\-\- -- 

Indeed, sir! May I inquire who has the honour to be the first? asked
Holmes with some asperity.

To the man of precisely scientific mind the work of Monsieur Bertillon
must always appeal strongly.

Then had you not better consult him?
