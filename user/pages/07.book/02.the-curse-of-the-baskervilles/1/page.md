I have in my pocket a manuscript, said Dr. James Mortimer.

I observed it as you entered the room, said Holmes.

It is an old manuscript.

Early eighteenth century, unless it is a forgery.

How can you say that, sir?

You have presented an inch or two of it to my examination all the time
that you have been talking. It would be a poor expert who could not give
the date of a document within a decade or so. You may possibly have read
my little monograph upon the subject. I put that at 1730.

The exact date is 1742. Dr. Mortimer drew it from his breast-pocket.
This family paper was committed to my care by Sir Charles Baskerville,
whose sudden and tragic death some three months ago created so much
excitement in Devonshire. I may say that I was his personal friend as
well as his medical attendant. He was a strong-minded man, sir, shrewd,
practical, and as unimaginative as I am myself. Yet he took this
document very seriously, and his mind was prepared for just such an end
as did eventually overtake him.

Holmes stretched out his hand for the manuscript and flattened it upon
his knee.

You will observe, Watson, the alternative use of the long s and the
short. It is one of several indications which enabled me to fix the
date.

I looked over his shoulder at the yellow paper and the faded script. At
the head was written: Baskerville Hall, and below in large,
scrawling figures: 1742.
