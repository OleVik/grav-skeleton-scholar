Yes, I have thought a good deal of it in the course of the day.

What do you make of it?

It is very bewildering. It has certainly a character of its own.
There are points of distinction about it. That change in the footprints,
for example. What do you make of that?

Mortimer said that the man had walked on tiptoe down that portion of
the alley.

He only repeated what some fool had said at the inquest. Why should a
man walk on tiptoe down the alley?

What then?

He was running, Watson -- running desperately, running for his life,
running until he burst his heart and fell dead upon his face.

Running from what?

There lies our problem. There are indications that the man was crazed
with fear before ever he began to run.

How can you say that?

I am presuming that the cause of his fears came to him across the
moor. If that were so, and it seems most probable, only a man who had
lost his wits would have run from the house instead of towards it. If
the gipsy's evidence may be taken as true, he ran with cries for help
in the direction where help was least likely to be. Then, again, whom
was he waiting for that night, and why was he waiting for him in the Yew
Alley rather than in his own house?

You think that he was waiting for someone?
