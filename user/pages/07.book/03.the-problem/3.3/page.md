You interest me exceedingly. Another point. Was the wicket-gate
closed?

Closed and padlocked.

How high was it?

About four feet high.

Then anyone could have got over it?

Yes.

And what marks did you see by the wicket-gate?

None in particular.

Good heaven! Did no one examine?

Yes, I examined myself.

And found nothing?

It was all very confused. Sir Charles had evidently stood there for
five or ten minutes.

How do you know that?

Because the ash had twice dropped from his cigar.

Excellent! This is a colleague, Watson, after our own heart. But the
marks?

He had left his own marks all over that small patch of gravel. I could
discern no others.

Sherlock Holmes struck his hand against his knee with an impatient
