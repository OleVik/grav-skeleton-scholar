one a moorland farmer, who all tell the same story of this dreadful
apparition, exactly corresponding to the hell-hound of the legend. I
assure you that there is a reign of terror in the district, and that it
is a hardy man who will cross the moor at night.

And you, a trained man of science, believe it to be supernatural?

I do not know what to believe.

Holmes shrugged his shoulders.

I have hitherto confined my investigations to this world, said he.
In a modest way I have combated evil, but to take on the Father of
Evil himself would, perhaps, be too ambitious a task. Yet you must admit
that the footmark is material.

The original hound was material enough to tug a man's throat out, and
yet he was diabolical as well.

I see that you have quite gone over to the supernaturalists. But now,
Dr. Mortimer, tell me this. If you hold these views, why have you come
to consult me at all? You tell me in the same breath that it is useless
to investigate Sir Charles's death, and that you desire me to do it.

I did not say that I desired you to do it.

Then, how can I assist you?

By advising me as to what I should do with Sir Henry Baskerville, who
arrives at Waterloo Station -- Dr. Mortimer looked at his watch -- in
exactly one hour and a quarter.

He being the heir?
