will be of help to me in my plans for the future if you will bring Sir
Henry Baskerville with you.

I will do so, Mr. Holmes. He scribbled the appointment on his
shirtcuff and hurried off in his strange, peering, absent-minded
fashion. Holmes stopped him at the head of the stair.

Only one more question, Dr. Mortimer. You say that before Sir Charles
Baskerville's death several people saw this apparition upon the moor?

Three people did.

Did any see it after?

I have not heard of any.

Thank you. Good morning.

Holmes returned to his seat with that quiet look of inward satisfaction
which meant that he had a congenial task before him.

Going out, Watson?

Unless I can help you.

No, my dear fellow, it is at the hour of action that I turn to you for
aid. But this is splendid, really unique from some points of view. When
you pass Bradley's, would you ask him to send up a pound of the
strongest shag tobacco? Thank you. It would be as well if you could make
it convenient not to return before evening. Then I should be very glad
to compare impressions as to this most interesting problem which has
been submitted to us this morning.
