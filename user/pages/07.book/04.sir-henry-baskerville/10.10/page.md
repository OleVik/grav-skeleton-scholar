It seems a singularly useless thing to steal, said Sherlock Holmes.
I confess that I share Dr. Mortimer's belief that it will not be long
before the missing boot is found.

And, now, gentlemen, said the baronet with decision, it seems to
me that I have spoken quite enough about the little that I know. It is

Your request is a very reasonable one, Holmes answered. Dr.
Mortimer, I think you could not do better than to tell your story as you
told it to us.

Thus encouraged, our scientific friend drew his papers from his pocket,
and presented the whole case as he had done upon the morning before. Sir

he when the long narrative was finished. Of course, I've heard of the
hound ever since I was in the nursery. It's the pet story of the
family, though I never thought of taking it seriously before. But as to
my uncle's death -- well, it all seems boiling up in my head, and I
can't get it clear yet. You don't seem quite to have made up your mind

suppose that fits into its place.

It seems to show that someone knows more than we do about what goes on
upon the moor, said Dr. Mortimer.
