And also, said Holmes, that someone is not ill-disposed towards
you, since they warn you of danger.

Or it may be that they wish, for their own purposes, to scare me
away.

Well, of course, that is possible also. I am very much indebted to
you, Dr. Mortimer, for introducing me to a problem which presents
several interesting alternatives. But the practical point which we now
have to decide, Sir Henry, is whether it is or is not advisable for you
to go to Baskerville Hall.

Why should I not go?

There seems to be danger.

Do you mean danger from this family fiend or do you mean danger from
human beings?

Well, that is what we have to find out.

Whichever it is, my answer is fixed. There is no devil in hell, Mr.
Holmes, and there is no man upon earth who can prevent me from going to
the home of my own people, and you may take that to be my final
answer. His dark brows knitted and his face flushed to a dusky red as
he spoke. It was evident that the fiery temper of the Baskervilles was
not extinct in this their last representative. Meanwhile, said he,
I have hardly had time to think over all that you have told me. It's
a big thing for a man to have to understand and to decide at one
sitting. I should like to have a quiet hour by myself to make up my
mind. Now, look here, Mr. Holmes, it's half-past eleven now and I am
going back right away to my hotel. Suppose you and your friend, Dr.
Watson, come round and lunch with us at two. I'll be able to tell you
more clearly then how this thing strikes me.
