direction of his eager eyes, I saw that a hansom cab with a man inside
which had halted on the other side of the street was now proceeding
slowly onward again.

There's our man, Watson! Come along! We'll have a good look at him,
if we can do no more.

At that instant I was aware of a bushy black beard and a pair of
piercing eyes turned upon us through the side window of the cab.
Instantly the trapdoor at the top flew up, something was screamed to the
driver, and the cab flew madly off down Regent Street. Holmes looked
eagerly round for another, but no empty one was in sight. Then he dashed
in wild pursuit amid the stream of the traffic, but the start was too
great, and already the cab was out of sight.

There now! said Holmes bitterly as he emerged panting and white with
vexation from the tide of vehicles. Was ever such bad luck and such
bad management, too? Watson, Watson, if you are an honest man you will
record this also and set it against my successes!

Who was the man?

I have not an idea.

A spy?

Well, it was evident from what we have heard that Baskerville has been
very closely shadowed by someone since he has been in town. How else
could it be known so quickly that it was the Northumberland Hotel which
he had chosen? If they had followed him the first day I argued that they
would follow him also the second. You may have observed that I twice
strolled over to the window while Dr. Mortimer was reading his legend.
