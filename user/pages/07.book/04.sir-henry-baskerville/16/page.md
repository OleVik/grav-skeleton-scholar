with extraordinary quickness and energy by our opponent, we have
betrayed ourselves and lost our man.

We had been sauntering slowly down Regent Street during this
conversation, and Dr. Mortimer, with his companion, had long vanished in
front of us.

There is no object in our following them, said Holmes. The shadow
has departed and will not return. We must see what further cards we have
in our hands and play them with decision. Could you swear to that man's
face within the cab?

I could swear only to the beard.

And so could I -- from which I gather that in all probability it was a
false one. A clever man upon so delicate an errand has no use for a
beard save to conceal his features. Come in here, Watson!

He turned into one of the district messenger offices, where he was
warmly greeted by the manager.

Ah, Wilson, I see you have not forgotten the little case in which I
had the good fortune to help you?

No, sir, indeed I have not. You saved my good name, and perhaps my
life.

My dear fellow, you exaggerate. I have some recollection, Wilson, that
you had among your boys a lad named Cartwright, who showed some ability
during the investigation.

Yes, sir, he is still with us.

Could you ring him up? -- thank you! And I should be glad to have
change of this five-pound note.
