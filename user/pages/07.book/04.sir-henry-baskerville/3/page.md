Who knew that you were going to the Northumberland Hotel? asked
Holmes, glancing keenly across at our visitor.

No one could have known. We only decided after I met Dr. Mortimer.

But Dr. Mortimer was no doubt already stopping there?

No, I had been staying with a friend, said the doctor. There was
no possible indication that we intended to go to this hotel.

Hum! Someone seems to be very deeply interested in your movements.
Out of the envelope he took a half-sheet of foolscap paper folded into
four. This he opened and spread flat upon the table. Across the middle
of it a single sentence had been formed by the expedient of pasting
printed words upon it. It ran: As you value your life or your reason
keep away from the moor. The word moor only was printed in ink.

Now, said Sir Henry Baskerville, perhaps you will tell me, Mr.
Holmes, what in thunder is the meaning of that, and who it is that takes
so much interest in my affairs?

What do you make of it, Dr. Mortimer? You must allow that there is
nothing supernatural about this, at any rate?

No, sir, but it might very well come from someone who was convinced
that the business is supernatural.

What business? asked Sir Henry sharply. It seems to me that all
you gentlemen know a great deal more than I do about my own affairs.

You shall share our knowledge before you leave this room, Sir Henry. I
promise you that, said Sherlock Holmes. We will confine ourselves
for the present with your permission to this
