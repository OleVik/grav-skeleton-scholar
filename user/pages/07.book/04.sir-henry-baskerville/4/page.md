very interesting document, which must have been put together and posted
yesterday evening. Have you yesterday's Times, Watson?

It is here in the corner.

Might I trouble you for it -- the inside page, please, with the leading
articles? He glanced swiftly over it, running his eyes up and down the
columns. Capital article this on free trade. Permit me to give you an
extract from it. 'You may be cajoled into imagining that your own
special trade or your own industry will be encouraged by a protective
tariff, but it stands to reason that such legislation must in the long
run keep away wealth from the country, diminish the value of our
imports, and lower the general conditions of life in this island.' What
do you think of that, Watson? cried Holmes in high glee, rubbing his
hands together with satisfaction. Don't you think that is an
admirable sentiment?

Dr. Mortimer looked at Holmes with an air of professional interest, and
Sir Henry Baskerville turned a pair of puzzled dark eyes upon me.

I don't know much about the tariff and things of that kind, said
he; but it seems to me we've got a bit off the trail so far as that
note is concerned.

On the contrary, I think we are particularly hot upon the trail, Sir
Henry. Watson here knows more about my methods than you do, but I fear
that even he has not quite grasped the significance of this sentence.

No, I confess that I see no connection.
