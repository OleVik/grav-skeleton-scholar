The German was sent for but professed to know nothing of the matter, nor
could any inquiry clear it up. Another item had been added to that
constant and apparently purposeless series of small mysteries which had
succeeded each other so rapidly. Setting aside the whole grim story of
Sir Charles's death, we had a line of inexplicable incidents all within

letter, the black-bearded spy in the hansom, the loss of the new brown
boot, the loss of the old black boot, and now the return of the new
brown boot. Holmes sat in silence in the cab as we drove back to Baker

second: -- 

Visited twenty-three hotels as directed, but sorry, to report unable
to trace cut sheet of Times. -- CARTWRIGHT.

There go two of my threads, Watson. There is nothing more stimulating

another scent.

We have still the cabman who drove the spy.

Exactly. I have wired to get his name and address from the Official
Registry. I should not be surprised if this were an answer to my
question.
