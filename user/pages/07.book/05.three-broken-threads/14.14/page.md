a cab from the rank. We followed their cab until it pulled up somewhere
near here.

This very door, said Holmes.

Well, I couldn't be sure of that, but I dare say my fare knew all
about it. We pulled up half-way down the street and waited an hour and a
half. Then the two gentlemen passed us, walking, and we followed down
Baker Street and along \-\- -- 

I know, said Holmes.

Until we got three-quarters down Regent Street. Then my gentleman
threw up the trap, and he cried that I should drive right away to
Waterloo Station as hard as I could go. I whipped up the mare and we
were there under the ten minutes. Then he paid up his two guineas, like
a good one, and away he went into the station. Only just as he was
leaving he turned round and he said: 'It might interest you to know
that you have been driving Mr. Sherlock Holmes.' That's how I come to
know the name.

I see. And you saw no more of him?

Not after he went into the station.

And how would you describe Mr. Sherlock Holmes?

The cabman scratched his head. Well, he wasn't altogether such an
easy gentleman to describe. I'd put him at forty years of age, and he
was of a middle height, two or three inches shorter than you, sir. He
was dressed like a toff, and he had a black beard, cut square at the
end, and a pale face. I don't know as I could say more than that.

Colour of his eyes?
