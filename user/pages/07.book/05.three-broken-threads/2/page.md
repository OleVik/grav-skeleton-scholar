She is an invalid lady, sir. Her husband was once mayor of Gloucester.
She always comes to us when she is in town.

Thank you; I am afraid I cannot claim her acquaintance. We have
established a most important fact by these questions, Watson, he
continued in a low voice as we went upstairs together. We know now
that the people who are so interested in our friend have not settled
down in his own hotel. That means that while they are, as we have seen,
very anxious to watch him, they are equally anxious that he should not
see them. Now, this is a most suggestive fact.

What does it suggest?

It suggests -- halloa, my dear fellow, what on earth is the matter?

As we came round the top of the stairs we had run up against Sir Henry
Baskerville himself. His face was flushed with anger, and he held an old
and dusty boot in one of his hands. So furious was he that he was hardly
articulate, and when he did speak it was in a much broader and more
Western dialect than any which we had heard from him in the morning.

Seems to me they are playing me for a sucker in this hotel, he
cried. They'll find they've started in to monkey with the wrong man
unless they are careful. By thunder, if that chap can't find my missing
boot there will be trouble. I can take a joke with the best, Mr. Holmes,
but they've got a bit over the mark this time.

Still looking for your boot?

Yes, sir, and mean to find it.

But, surely, you said that it was a new brown boot?
