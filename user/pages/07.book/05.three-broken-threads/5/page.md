Well, I don't profess to understand it yet. This case of yours is
very complex, Sir Henry. When taken in conjunction with your uncle's
death I am not sure that of all the five hundred cases of capital
importance which I have handled there is one which cuts so deep. But we
hold several threads in our hands, and the odds are that one or other of
them guides us to the truth. We may waste time in following the wrong
one, but sooner or later we must come upon the right.

We had a pleasant luncheon in which little was said of the business
which had brought us together. It was in the private sitting-room to
which we afterwards repaired that Holmes asked Baskerville what were his
intentions.

To go to Baskerville Hall.

And when?

At the end of the week.

On the whole, said Holmes, I think that your decision is a wise
one. I have ample evidence that you are being dogged in London, and amid
the millions of this great city it is difficult to discover who these
people are or what their object can be. If their intentions are evil
they might do you a mischief, and we should be powerless to prevent it.
You did not know, Dr. Mortimer, that you were followed this morning from
my house?

Dr. Mortimer started violently.

Followed! By whom?
