I saw his dark face lit up with a boyish enthusiasm as he gazed about
him. The light beat upon him where he stood, but long shadows trailed
down the walls and hung like a black canopy above him. Barrymore had
returned from taking our luggage to our rooms. He stood in front of us
now with the subdued manner of a well-trained servant. He was a
remarkable-looking man, tall, handsome, with a square black beard and
pale, distinguished features.

Would you wish dinner to be served at once, sir?

Is it ready?

In a very few minutes, sir. You will find hot water in your rooms. My
wife and I will be happy, Sir Henry, to stay with you until you have
made your fresh arrangements, but you will understand that under the new
conditions this house will require a considerable staff.

What new conditions?

I only meant, sir, that Sir Charles led a very retired life, and we
were able to look after his wants. You would, naturally, wish to have
more company, and so you will need changes in your household.

Do you mean that your wife and you wish to leave?

Only when it is quite convenient to you, sir.

But your family have been with us for several generations, have they
not? I should be sorry to begin my life here by breaking an old family
connection.

I seemed to discern some signs of emotion upon the butler's white face.
