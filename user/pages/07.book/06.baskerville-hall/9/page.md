Welcome, Sir Henry! Welcome to Baskerville Hall!

A tall man had stepped from the shadow of the porch to open the door of
the wagonette. The figure of a woman was silhouetted against the yellow
light of the hall. She came out and helped the man to hand down our
bags.

You don't mind my driving straight home, Sir Henry? said Dr.
Mortimer. My wife is expecting me.

Surely you will stay and have some dinner?

No, I must go. I shall probably find some work awaiting me. I would
stay to show you over the house, but Barrymore will be a better guide
than I. Good-bye, and never hesitate night or day to send for me if I
can be of service.

The wheels died away down the drive while Sir Henry and I turned into
the hall, and the door clanged heavily behind us. It was a fine
apartment in which we found ourselves, large, lofty, and heavily
raftered with huge balks of age-blackened oak. In the great
old-fashioned fireplace behind the high iron dogs a log-fire crackled
and snapped. Sir Henry and I held out our hands to it, for we were numb
from our long drive. Then we gazed round us at the high, thin window of
old stained glass, the oak panelling, the stags' heads, the
coats-of-arms upon the walls, all dim and sombre in the subdued light of
the central lamp.

It's just as I imagined it, said Sir Henry. Is it not the very
picture of an old family home? To think that this should be the same
hall in which for five hundred years my people have lived. It strikes me
solemn to think of it.
