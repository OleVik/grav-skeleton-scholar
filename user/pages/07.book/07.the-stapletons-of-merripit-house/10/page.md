sank back into a melancholy, throbbing murmur once again. Stapleton
looked at me with a curious expression in his face.

Queer place, the moor! said he.

But what is it?

The peasants say it is the Hound of the Baskervilles calling for its
prey. I've heard it once or twice before, but never quite so loud.

I looked round, with a chill of fear in my heart, at the huge swelling
plain, mottled with the green patches of rushes. Nothing stirred over
the vast expanse save a pair of ravens, which croaked loudly from a tor
behind us.

You are an educated man. You don't believe such nonsense as that?
said I. What do you think is the cause of so strange a sound?

Bogs make queer noises sometimes. It's the mud settling, or the water
rising, or something.

No, no, that was a living voice.

Well, perhaps it was. Did you ever hear a bittern booming?

No, I never did.

It's a very rare bird -- practically extinct -- in England now, but all
things are possible upon the moor. Yes, I should not be surprised to
learn that what we have heard is the cry of the last of the bitterns.

It's the weirdest, strangest thing that ever I heard in my life.
