I cannot explain. She spoke in a low, eager voice, with a curious
lisp in her utterance. But for God's sake do what I ask you. Go back

Man, man! she cried. Can you not tell when a warning is for your
own good? Go back to London! Start to-night! Get away from this place at
all costs! Hush, my brother is coming! Not a word of what I have said.
Would you mind getting that orchid for me among the mares-tails yonder?
We are very rich in orchids on the moor, though, of course, you are
rather late to see the beauties of the place.

Stapleton had abandoned the chase and came back to us breathing hard and
flushed with his exertions.

Halloa, Beryl! said he, and it seemed to me that the tone of his
greeting was not altogether a cordial one.

Well, Jack, you are very hot.

Yes, I was chasing a Cyclopides. He is very rare and seldom found in
the late autumn. What a pity that I should have missed him! He spoke
unconcernedly, but his small light eyes glanced incessantly from the
girl to me.

You have introduced yourselves, I can see.

Yes. I was telling Sir Henry that it was rather late for him to see
the true beauties of the moor.

Why, who do you think this is?

I imagine that it must be Sir Henry Baskerville.
