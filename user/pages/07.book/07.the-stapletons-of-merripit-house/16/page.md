Lepidoptera? I think it is the most complete one in the south-west of
England. By the time that you have looked through them lunch will be
almost ready.

But I was eager to get back to my charge. The melancholy of the moor,
the death of the unfortunate pony, the weird sound which had been
associated with the grim legend of the Baskervilles, all these things
tinged my thoughts with sadness. Then on the top of these more or less
vague impressions there had come the definite and distinct warning of
Miss Stapleton, delivered with such intense earnestness that I could not
doubt that some grave and deep reason lay behind it. I resisted all
pressure to stay for lunch, and I set off at once upon my return
journey, taking the grass-grown path by which we had come.

It seems, however, that there must have been some short cut for those
who knew it, for before I had reached the road I was astounded to see
Miss Stapleton sitting upon a rock by the side of the track. Her face
was beautifully flushed with her exertions, and she held her hand to her
side.

I have run all the way in order to cut you off, Dr. Watson, said
she. I had not even time to put on my hat. I must not stop, or my
brother may miss me. I wanted to say to you how sorry I am about the
stupid mistake I made in thinking that you were Sir Henry. Please forget
the words I said, which have no application whatever to you.

But I can't forget them, Miss Stapleton, said I. I am Sir
Henry's friend, and his welfare is a very close concern of mine. Tell
me why it was that you were so eager that Sir Henry should return to
London.
