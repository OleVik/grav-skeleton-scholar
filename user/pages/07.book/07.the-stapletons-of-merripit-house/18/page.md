world is wide. Why should he wish to live at the place of danger?

Because it is the place of danger. That is Sir Henry's nature. I fear
that unless you can give me some more definite information than this it
would be impossible to get him to move.

I cannot say anything definite, for I do not know anything definite.

I would ask you one more question, Miss Stapleton. If you meant no
more than this when you first spoke to me, why should you not wish your
brother to overhear what you said? There is nothing to which he, or
anyone else, could object.

My brother is very anxious to have the Hall inhabited, for he thinks
it is for the good of the poor folk upon the moor. He would be very
angry if he knew that I have said anything which might induce Sir Henry
to go away. But I have done my duty now and I will say no more. I must
get back, or he will miss me and suspect that I have seen you.
Good-bye! She turned and had disappeared in a few minutes among the
scattered boulders, while I, with my soul full of vague fears, pursued
my way to Baskerville Hall.
