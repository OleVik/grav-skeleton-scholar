and permanent home would be secured for the Barrymores. But surely such
an explanation as that would be quite inadequate to account for the deep
and subtle scheming which seemed to be weaving an invisible net round
the young baronet. Holmes himself had said that no more complex case had
come to him in all the long series of his sensational investigations. I
prayed, as I walked back along the gray, lonely road, that my friend
might soon be freed from his preoccupations and able to come down to
take this heavy burden of responsibility from my shoulders.

Suddenly my thoughts were interrupted by the sound of running feet
behind me and by a voice which called me by name. I turned, expecting to
see Dr. Mortimer, but to my surprise it was a stranger who was pursuing
me. He was a small, slim, clean-shaven, prim-faced man, flaxen-haired
and lean-jawed, between thirty and forty years of age, dressed in a gray
suit and wearing a straw hat. A tin box for botanical specimens hung
over his shoulder and he carried a green butterfly-net in one of his
hands.

You will, I am sure, excuse my presumption, Dr. Watson, said he, as
he came panting up to where I stood. Here on the moor we are homely
folk and do not wait for formal introductions. You may possibly have
heard my name from our mutual friend, Mortimer. I am Stapleton, of
Merripit House.

Your net and box would have told me as much, said I, for I knew
that Mr. Stapleton was a naturalist. But how did you know me?

I have been calling on Mortimer, and he pointed you out to me from the
window of his surgery as you passed. As our road lay the same way I
thought that I would overtake you and introduce myself. I trust that Sir
Henry is none the worse for his journey?
