You think, then, that some dog pursued Sir Charles, and that he died
of fright in consequence?

Have you any better explanation?

I have not come to any conclusion.

Has Mr. Sherlock Holmes?

The words took away my breath for an instant, but a glance at the placid
face and steadfast eyes of my companion showed that no surprise was
intended.

It is useless for us to pretend that we do not know you, Dr. Watson,
said he. The records of your detective have reached us here, and you
could not celebrate him without being known yourself. When Mortimer told
me your name he could not deny your identity. If you are here, then it
follows that Mr. Sherlock Holmes is interesting himself in the matter,
and I am naturally curious to know what view he may take.

I am afraid that I cannot answer that question.

May I ask if he is going to honour us with a visit himself?

He cannot leave town at present. He has other cases which engage his
attention.

What a pity! He might throw some light on that which is so dark to us.
But as to your own researches, if there is any possible way in which I
can be of service to you I trust that you will command me. If I had any
indication of the nature of your suspicions or how you propose to
investigate the case, I might perhaps even now give you some aid or
advice.
