when I had fallen into a light sleep I heard a key turn somewhere in a
lock, but I could not tell whence the sound came. What it all means I
cannot guess, but there is some secret business going on in this house
of gloom which sooner or later we shall get to the bottom of. I do not
trouble you with my theories, for you asked me to furnish you only with
facts. I have had a long talk with Sir Henry this morning, and we have
made a plan of campaign founded upon my observations of last night. I
will not speak about it just now, but it should make my next report
interesting reading.
