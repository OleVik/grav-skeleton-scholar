whether he had received the telegram himself. Barrymore said that he
had.

Did the boy deliver it into your own hands? asked Sir Henry.

Barrymore looked surprised, and considered for a little time.

No, said he, I was in the box-room at the time, and my wife
brought it up to me.

Did you answer it yourself?

No; I told my wife what to answer and she went down to write it.

In the evening he recurred to the subject of his own accord.

I could not quite understand the object of your questions this
morning, Sir Henry, said he. I trust that they do not mean that I
have done anything to forfeit your confidence?

Sir Henry had to assure him that it was not so and pacify him by giving
him a considerable part of his old wardrobe, the London outfit having
now all arrived.

Mrs. Barrymore is of interest to me. She is a heavy, solid person, very
limited, intensely respectable, and inclined to be puritanical. You
could hardly conceive a less emotional subject. Yet I have told you how,
on the first night here, I heard her sobbing bitterly, and since then I
have more than once observed traces of tears upon her face. Some deep
sorrow gnaws ever at her heart. Sometimes I wonder if she has a guilty
memory which haunts her, and sometimes I suspect Barrymore of being a
domestic tyrant. I have always felt that there was something singular
and questionable in this man's character, but the adventure of last
night brings all my suspicions to a head.
