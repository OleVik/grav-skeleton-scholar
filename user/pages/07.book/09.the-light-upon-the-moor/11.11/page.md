as he tip-toed down the passage. Then he passed through the same door as
before, and the light of the candle framed it in the darkness and shot
one single yellow beam across the gloom of the corridor. We shuffled
cautiously towards it, trying every plank before we dared to put our
whole weight upon it. We had taken the precaution of leaving our boots
behind us, but, even so, the old boards snapped and creaked beneath our
tread. Sometimes it seemed impossible that he should fail to hear our
approach. However, the man is fortunately rather deaf, and he was
entirely preoccupied in that which he was doing. When at last we reached
the door and peeped through we found him crouching at the window, candle
in hand, his white, intent face pressed against the pane, exactly as I
had seen him two nights before.

We had arranged no plan of campaign, but the baronet is a man to whom
the most direct way is always the most natural. He walked into the room,
and as he did so Barrymore sprang up from the window with a sharp hiss
of his breath and stood, livid and trembling, before us. His dark eyes,
glaring out of the white mask of his face, were full of horror and
astonishment as he gazed from Sir Henry to me.

What are you doing here, Barrymore?

Nothing, sir. His agitation was so great that he could hardly speak,
and the shadows sprang up and down from the shaking of his candle. It
was the window, sir. I go round at night to see that they are
fastened.

On the second floor?

Yes, sir, all the windows.
