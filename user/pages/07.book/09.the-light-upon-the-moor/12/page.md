Look here, Barrymore, said Sir Henry, sternly; we have made up our
minds to have the truth out of you, so it will save you trouble to tell
it sooner rather than later. Come, now! No lies! What were you doing at
that window?

The fellow looked at us in a helpless way, and he wrung his hands
together like one who is in the last extremity of doubt and misery.

I was doing no harm, sir. I was holding a candle to the window.

And why were you holding a candle to the window?

Don't ask me, Sir Henry -- don't ask me! I give you my word, sir,
that it is not my secret, and that I cannot tell it. If it concerned no
one but myself I would not try to keep it from you.

A sudden idea occurred to me, and I took the candle from the trembling
hand of the butler.

He must have been holding it as a signal, said I. Let us see if
there is any answer. I held it as he had done, and stared out into the
darkness of the night. Vaguely I could discern the black bank of the
trees and the lighter expanse of the moor, for the moon was behind the
clouds. And then I gave a cry of exultation, for a tiny pin-point of
yellow light had suddenly transfixed the dark veil, and glowed steadily
in the centre of the black square framed by the window.

There it is! I cried.

No, no, sir, it is nothing -- nothing at all! the butler broke in;
I assure you, sir \-\- --
