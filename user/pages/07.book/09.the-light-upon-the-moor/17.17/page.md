We must close in on him rapidly, for he is said to be a desperate
fellow. We shall take him by surprise and have him at our mercy before
he can resist.

I say, Watson, said the baronet, what would Holmes say to this?
How about that hour of darkness in which the power of evil is exalted?

As if in answer to his words there rose suddenly out of the vast gloom
of the moor that strange cry which I had already heard upon the borders
of the great Grimpen Mire. It came with the wind through the silence of
the night, a long, deep mutter, then a rising howl, and then the sad
moan in which it died away. Again and again it sounded, the whole air
throbbing with it, strident, wild, and menacing. The baronet caught my
sleeve and his face glimmered white through the darkness.

My God, what's that, Watson?

I don't know. It's a sound they have on the moor. I heard it once
before.

It died away, and an absolute silence closed in upon us. We stood
straining our ears, but nothing came.

Watson, said the baronet, it was the cry of a hound.

My blood ran cold in my veins, for there was a break in his voice which
told of the sudden horror which had seized him.

What do they call this sound? he asked.

Who?

The folk on the country-side.
