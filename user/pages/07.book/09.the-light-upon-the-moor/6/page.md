Finally Stapleton turned upon his heel and beckoned in a peremptory way
to his sister, who, after an irresolute glance at Sir Henry, walked off
by the side of her brother. The naturalist's angry gestures showed that
the lady was included in his displeasure. The baronet stood for a minute
looking after them, and then he walked slowly back the way that he had
come, his head hanging, the very picture of dejection.

What all this meant I could not imagine, but I was deeply ashamed to
have witnessed so intimate a scene without my friend's knowledge. I ran
down the hill therefore and met the baronet at the bottom. His face was
flushed with anger and his brows were wrinkled, like one who is at his
wit's ends what to do.

Halloa, Watson! Where have you dropped from? said he. You don't
mean to say that you came after me in spite of all?

I explained everything to him: how I had found it impossible to remain
behind, how I had followed him, and how I had witnessed all that had
occurred. For an instant his eyes blazed at me, but my frankness
disarmed his anger, and he broke at last into a rather rueful laugh.

You would have thought the middle of that prairie a fairly safe place
for a man to be private, said he, but, by thunder, the whole
country-side seems to have been out to see me do my wooing -- and a
mighty poor wooing at that! Where had you engaged a seat?

I was on that hill.

Quite in the back row, eh? But her brother was well up to the front.
Did you see him come out on us?
