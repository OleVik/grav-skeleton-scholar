I don't say now that he isn't a crazy man, said Sir Henry; I
can't forget the look in his eyes when he ran at me this morning, but I
must allow that no man could make a more handsome apology than he has
done.

Did he give any explanation of his conduct?

His sister is everything in his life, he says. That is natural enough,
and I am glad that he should understand her value. They have always been
together, and according to his account he has been a very lonely man
with only her as a companion, so that the thought of losing her was
really terrible to him. He had not understood, he said, that I was
becoming attached to her, but when he saw with his own eyes that it was
really so, and that she might be taken away from him, it gave him such a
shock that for a time he was not responsible for what he said or did. He
was very sorry for all that had passed, and he recognized how foolish
and how selfish it was that he should imagine that he could hold a
beautiful woman like his sister to himself for her whole life. If she
had to leave him he had rather it was to a neighbour like myself than to
anyone else. But in any case it was a blow to him, and it would take him
some time before he could prepare himself to meet it. He would withdraw
all opposition upon his part if I would promise for three months to let
the matter rest and to be content with cultivating the lady's
friendship during that time without claiming her love. This I promised,
and so the matter rests.

So there is one of our small mysteries cleared up. It is something to
have touched bottom anywhere in this bog in which we are floundering. We
know now why Stapleton looked with disfavour upon his sister's
suitor -- even when that suitor was so eligible a one as Sir Henry. And
now I pass on to another
