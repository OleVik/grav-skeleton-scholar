might find ourselves at the end of all our difficulties. To this one
purpose I must now devote all my energies.

My first impulse was to tell Sir Henry all my plans. My second and
wisest one is to play my own game and speak as little as possible to
anyone. He is silent and distrait. His nerves have been strangely shaken
by that sound upon the moor. I will say nothing to add to his anxieties,
but I will take my own steps to attain my own end.

We had a small scene this morning after breakfast. Barrymore asked leave
to speak with Sir Henry, and they were closeted in his study some little
time. Sitting in the billiard-room I more than once heard the sound of
voices raised, and I had a pretty good idea what the point was which was
under discussion. After a time the baronet opened his door and called
for me.

Barrymore considers that he has a grievance, he said. He thinks
that it was unfair on our part to hunt his brother-in-law down when he,
of his own free will, had told us the secret.

The butler was standing very pale but very collected before us.

I may have spoken too warmly, sir, said he, and if I have, I am
sure that I beg your pardon. At the same time, I was very much surprised
when I heard you two gentlemen come back this morning and learned that
you had been chasing Selden. The poor fellow has enough to fight against
without my putting more upon his track.

If you had told us of your own free will it would have been a
different thing, said the baronet, you only told us, or rather your
wife only told us, when it was forced from you and you could not help
yourself.
