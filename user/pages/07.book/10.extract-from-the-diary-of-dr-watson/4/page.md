I didn't think you would have taken advantage of it, Sir
Henry -- indeed I didn't.

The man is a public danger. There are lonely houses scattered over the
moor, and he is a fellow who would stick at nothing. You only want to
get a glimpse of his face to see that. Look at Mr. Stapleton's house,
for example, with no one but himself to defend it. There's no safety
for anyone until he is under lock and key.

He'll break into no house, sir. I give you my solemn word upon that.
But he will never trouble anyone in this country again. I assure you,
Sir Henry, that in a very few days the necessary arrangements will have
been made and he will be on his way to South America. For God's sake,
sir, I beg of you not to let the police know that he is still on the
moor. They have given up the chase there, and he can lie quiet until the
ship is ready for him. You can't tell on him without getting my wife
and me into trouble. I beg you, sir, to say nothing to the police.

What do you say, Watson?

I shrugged my shoulders. If he were safely out of the country it would
relieve the tax-payer of a burden.

But how about the chance of his holding someone up before he goes?

He would not do anything so mad, sir. We have provided him with all
that he can want. To commit a crime would be to show where he was
hiding.

That is true, said Sir Henry. Well, Barrymore  --
