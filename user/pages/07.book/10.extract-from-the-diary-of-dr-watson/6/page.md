Well, Sir Henry, your uncle had a letter that morning. He had usually
a great many letters, for he was a public man and well known for his
kind heart, so that everyone who was in trouble was glad to turn to him.
But that morning, as it chanced, there was only this one letter, so I
took the more notice of it. It was from Coombe Tracey, and it was
addressed in a woman's hand.

Well?

Well, sir, I thought no more of the matter, and never would have done
had it not been for my wife. Only a few weeks ago she was cleaning out
Sir Charles's study -- it had never been touched since his death -- and
she found the ashes of a burned letter in the back of the grate. The
greater part of it was charred to pieces, but one little slip, the end
of a page, hung together, and the writing could still be read, though it
was gray on a black ground. It seemed to us to be a postscript at the
end of the letter, and it said: 'Please, please, as you are a
gentleman, burn this letter, and be at the gate by ten o clock. Beneath
it were signed the initials L. L.

Have you got that slip?

No, sir, it crumbled all to bits after we moved it.

Had Sir Charles received any other letters in the same writing?

Well, sir, I took no particular notice of his letters. I should not
have noticed this one, only it happened to come alone.

And you have no idea who L. L. is?

No, sir. No more than you have. But I expect if we could lay our hands
upon that lady we should know more about Sir Charles's death.
