such a day since I had Sir John Morland for trespass, because he shot in
his own warren.

How on earth did you do that?

Look it up in the books, sir. It will repay reading -- Frankland v.
Morland, Court of Queen's Bench. It cost me 200 pounds, but I got my
verdict.

Did it do you any good?

None, sir, none. I am proud to say that I had no interest in the
matter. I act entirely from a sense of public duty. I have no doubt, for
example, that the Fernworthy people will burn me in effigy to-night. I
told the police last time they did it that they should stop these
disgraceful exhibitions. The County Constabulary is in a scandalous
state, sir, and it has not afforded me the protection to which I am
entitled. The case of Frankland v. Regina will bring the matter before
the attention of the public. I told them that they would have occasion
to regret their treatment of me, and already my words have come true.

How so? I asked.

The old man put on a very knowing expression.

Because I could tell them what they are dying to know; but nothing
would induce me to help the rascals in any way.

I had been casting round for some excuse by which I could get away from
his gossip, but now I began to wish to hear more of it. I had seen
enough of the contrary nature of the old sinner to understand that any
strong sign of interest would be the surest way to stop his confidences.
