Some poaching case, no doubt? said I, with an indifferent manner.

Ha, ha, my boy, a very much more important matter than that! What
about the convict on the moor?

I started. You don't mean that you know where he is? said I.

I may not know exactly where he is, but I am quite sure that I could
help the police to lay their hands on him. Has it never struck you that
the way to catch that man was to find out where he got his food, and so
trace it to him?

He certainly seemed to be getting uncomfortably near the truth. No
doubt, said I; but how do you know that he is anywhere upon the
moor?

I know it because I have seen with my own eyes the messenger who takes
him his food.

My heart sank for Barrymore. It was a serious thing to be in the power
of this spiteful old busybody. But his next remark took a weight from my
mind.

You'll be surprised to hear that his food is taken to him by a child.
I see him every day through my telescope upon the roof. He passes along
the same path at the same hour, and to whom should he be going except to
the convict?

Here was luck indeed! And yet I suppressed all appearance of interest. A
child! Barrymore had said that our unknown was supplied by a boy. It was
on his track, and not upon the convict's, that Frankland had stumbled.
If I could get his knowledge it might save me a long and weary hunt. But
incredulity and indifference were evidently my strongest cards.
