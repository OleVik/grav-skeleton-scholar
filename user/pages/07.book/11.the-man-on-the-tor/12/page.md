I should say that it was much more likely that it was the son of one
of the moorland shepherds taking out his father's dinner.

The least appearance of opposition struck fire out of the old autocrat.
His eyes looked malignantly at me, and his gray whiskers bristled like
those of an angry cat.

Indeed, sir! said he, pointing out over the wide-stretching moor.
Do you see that Black Tor over yonder? Well, do you see the low hill
beyond with the thornbush upon it? It is the stoniest part of the whole
moor. Is that a place where a shepherd would be likely to take his
station? Your suggestion, sir, is a most absurd one.

I meekly answered that I had spoken without knowing all the facts. My
submission pleased him and led him to further confidences.

You may be sure, sir, that I have very good grounds before I come to
an opinion. I have seen the boy again and again with his bundle. Every
day, and sometimes twice a day, I have been able -- but wait a moment,
Dr. Watson. Do my eyes deceive me, or is there at the present moment
something moving upon that hill- side?

It was several miles off, but I could distinctly see a small dark dot
against the dull green and gray.

Come, sir, come! cried Frankland, rushing upstairs. You will see

The telescope, a formidable instrument mounted upon a tripod, stood upon
the flat leads of the house. Frankland clapped his eye to it and gave a
cry of satisfaction.
