You knew him, did you not?

I have already said that I owe a great deal to his kindness. If I am
able to support myself it is largely due to the interest which he took
in my unhappy situation.

Did you correspond with him?

The lady looked quickly up with an angry gleam in her hazel eyes.

What is the object of these questions? she asked sharply.

The object is to avoid a public scandal. It is better that I should
ask them here than that the matter should pass outside our control.

She was silent and her face was still very pale. At last she looked up
with something reckless and defiant in her manner.

Well, I'll answer, she said. What are your questions?

Did you correspond with Sir Charles?

I certainly wrote to him once or twice to acknowledge his delicacy and
his generosity.

Have you the dates of those letters?

No.

Have you ever met him?

Yes, once or twice, when he came into Coombe Tracey. He was a very
retiring man, and he preferred to do good by stealth.
