But if you saw him so seldom and wrote so seldom, how did he know
enough about your affairs to be able to help you, as you say that he has
done?

She met my difficulty with the utmost readiness.

There were several gentlemen who knew my sad history and united to
help me. One was Mr. Stapleton, a neighbour and intimate friend of Sir
Charles's. He was exceedingly kind, and it was through him that Sir
Charles learned about my affairs.

I knew already that Sir Charles Baskerville had made Stapleton his
almoner upon several occasions, so the lady's statement bore the
impress of truth upon it.

Did you ever write to Sir Charles asking him to meet you? I
continued.

Mrs. Lyons flushed with anger again.

Really, sir, this is a very extraordinary question.

I am sorry, madam, but I must repeat it.

Then I answer, certainly not.

Not on the very day of Sir Charles's death?

The flush had faded in an instant, and a deathly face was before me. Her
dry lips could not speak the No which I saw rather than heard.

Surely your memory deceives you, said I. I could even quote a
passage of your letter. It ran 'Please, please, as you are a gentleman,
burn this letter, and be at the gate by ten o'clock.'
