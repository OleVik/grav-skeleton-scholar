That is a private matter. I cannot tell it.

You acknowledge then that you made an appointment with Sir Charles at
the very hour and place at which he met his death, but you deny that you
kept the appointment.

That is the truth.

Again and again I cross-questioned her, but I could never get past that
point.

Mrs. Lyons, said I, as I rose from this long and inconclusive
interview, you are taking a very great responsibility and putting
yourself in a very false position by not making an absolutely clean
breast of all that you know. If I have to call in the aid of the police
you will find how seriously you are compromised. If your position is
innocent, why did you in the first instance deny having written to Sir
Charles upon that date?

Because I feared that some false conclusion might be drawn from it and
that I might find myself involved in a scandal.

And why were you so pressing that Sir Charles should destroy your
letter?

If you have read the letter you will know.

I did not say that I had read all the letter.

You quoted some of it.

I quoted the postscript. The letter had, as I said, been burned and it
was not all legible. I ask you once again why it was that you were so
pressing that Sir Charles should destroy this letter which he received
on the day of his death.

The matter is a very private one.
