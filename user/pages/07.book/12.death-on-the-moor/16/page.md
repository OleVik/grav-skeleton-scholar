Why about Sir Henry in particular? I could not help asking.

Because I had suggested that he should come over. When he did not come
I was surprised, and I naturally became alarmed for his safety when I
heard cries upon the moor. By the way -- his eyes darted again from my
face to Holmes's -- did you hear anything else besides a cry?

No, said Holmes; did you?

No.

What do you mean, then?

Oh, you know the stories that the peasants tell about a phantom hound,
and so on. It is said to be heard at night upon the moor. I was
wondering if there were any evidence of such a sound to-night.

We heard nothing of the kind, said I.

And what is your theory of this poor fellow's death?

I have no doubt that anxiety and exposure have driven him off his
head. He has rushed about the moor in a crazy state and eventually
fallen over here and broken his neck.

That seems the most reasonable theory, said Stapleton, and he gave a
sigh which I took to indicate his relief. What do you think about it,
Mr. Sherlock Holmes?

My friend bowed his compliments.

You are quick at identification, said he.

We have been expecting you in these parts since Dr. Watson came down.
You are in time to see a tragedy.
