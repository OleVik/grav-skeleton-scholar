Yes, indeed. I have no doubt that my friend's explanation will cover
the facts. I will take an unpleasant remembrance back to London with me
to-morrow.

Oh, you return to-morrow?

That is my intention.

I hope your visit has cast some light upon those occurrences which
have puzzled us?

Holmes shrugged his shoulders.

One cannot always have the success for which one hopes. An
investigator needs facts, and not legends or rumours. It has not been a
satisfactory case.

My friend spoke in his frankest and most unconcerned manner. Stapleton
still looked hard at him. Then he turned to me.

I would suggest carrying this poor fellow to my house, but it would
give my sister such a fright that I do not feel justified in doing it. I
think that if we put something over his face he will be safe until
morning.

And so it was arranged. Resisting Stapleton's offer of hospitality,
Holmes and I set off to Baskerville Hall, leaving the naturalist to
return alone. Looking back we saw the figure moving slowly away over the
broad moor, and behind him that one black smudge on the silvered slope
which showed where the man was lying who had come so horribly to his
end.
