To see Mrs. Laura Lyons?

Exactly.

Well done! Our researches have evidently been running on parallel
lines, and when we unite our results I expect we shall have a fairly
full knowledge of the case.

Well, I am glad from my heart that you are here, for indeed the
responsibility and the mystery were both becoming too much for my
nerves. But how in the name of wonder did you come here, and what have
you been doing? I thought that you were in Baker Street working out that
case of blackmailing.

That was what I wished you to think.

Then you use me, and yet do not trust me! I cried with some
bitterness. I think that I have deserved better at your hands,
Holmes.

My dear fellow, you have been invaluable to me in this as in many
other cases, and I beg that you will forgive me if I have seemed to play
a trick upon you. In truth, it was partly for your own sake that I did
it, and it was my appreciation of the danger which you ran which led me
to come down and examine the matter for myself. Had I been with Sir
Henry and you it is confident that my point of view would have been the
same as yours, and my presence would have warned our very formidable
opponents to be on their guard. As it is, I have been able to get about
as I could not possibly have done had I been living in the Hall, and I
remain an unknown factor in the business, ready to throw in all my
weight at a critical moment.

But why keep me in the dark?
