already almost at my mercy. There is but one danger which can threaten
us. It is that he should strike before we are ready to do so. Another
day -- two at the most -- and I have my case complete, but until then
guard your charge as closely as ever a fond mother watched her ailing
child. Your mission to-day has justified itself, and yet I could almost
wish that you had not left his side. Hark!

A terrible scream -- a prolonged yell of horror and anguish -- burst out
of the silence of the moor. That frightful cry turned the blood to ice
in my veins.

Oh, my God! I gasped. What is it? What does it mean?

Holmes had sprung to his feet, and I saw his dark, athletic outline at
the door of the hut, his shoulders stooping, his head thrust forward,
his face peering into the darkness.

Hush! he whispered. Hush!

The cry had been loud on account of its vehemence, but it had pealed out
from somewhere far off on the shadowy plain. Now it burst upon our ears,
nearer, louder, more urgent than before.

Where is it? Holmes whispered; and I knew from the thrill of his
voice that he, the man of iron, was shaken to the soul. Where is it,
Watson?

There, I think. I pointed into the darkness.

No, there!

Again the agonized cry swept through the silent night, louder and much
nearer than ever. And a new sound mingled with it, a deep, muttered
rumble, musical and yet menacing, rising and falling like the low,
constant murmur of the sea.
