We're at close grips at last, said Holmes as we walked together
across the moor. What a nerve the fellow has! How he pulled himself
together in the face of what must have been a paralyzing shock when he
found that the wrong man had fallen a victim to his plot. I told you in
London, Watson, and I tell you now again, that we have never had a
foeman more worthy of our steel.

I am sorry that he has seen you.

And so was I at first. But there was no getting out of it.

What effect do you think it will have upon his plans now that he knows
you are here?

It may cause him to be more cautious, or it may drive him to desperate
measures at once. Like most clever criminals, he may be too confident in
his own cleverness and imagine that he has completely deceived us.

Why should we not arrest him at once?

My dear Watson, you were born to be a man of action. Your instinct is
always to do something energetic. But supposing, for argument's sake,
that we had him arrested to-night, what on earth the better off should
we be for that? We could prove nothing against him. There's the
devilish cunning of it! If he were acting through a human agent we could
get some evidence, but if we were to drag this great dog to the light of
day it would not help us in putting a rope round the neck of its
master.

Surely we have a case.
