required us to be in town. We hope very soon to return to Devonshire.
Will you remember to give them that message?

If you insist upon it.

There is no alternative, I assure you.

I saw by the baronet's clouded brow that he was deeply hurt by what he
regarded as our desertion.

When do you desire to go? he asked coldly.

Immediately after breakfast. We will drive in to Coombe Tracey, but
Watson will leave his things as a pledge that he will come back to you.
Watson, you will send a note to Stapleton to tell him that you regret
that you cannot come.

I have a good mind to go to London with you, said the baronet. Why
should I stay here alone?

Because it is your post of duty. Because you gave me your word that
you would do as you were told, and I tell you to stay.

All right, then, I'll stay.

One more direction! I wish you to drive to Merripit House. Send back
your trap, however, and let them know that you intend to walk home.

To walk across the moor?

Yes.

But that is the very thing which you have so often cautioned me not to
do.
