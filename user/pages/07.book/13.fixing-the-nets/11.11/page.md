This time you may do it with safety. If I had not every confidence in
your nerve and courage I would not suggest it, but it is essential that
you should do it.

Then I will do it.

And as you value your life do not go across the moor in any direction
save along the straight path which leads from Merripit House to the
Grimpen Road, and is your natural way home.

I will do just what you say.

Very good. I should be glad to get away as soon after breakfast as
possible, so as to reach London in the afternoon.

I was much astounded by this programme, though I remembered that Holmes
had said to Stapleton on the night before that his visit would terminate
next day. It had not crossed my mind, however, that he would wish me to
go with him, nor could I understand how we could both be absent at a
moment which he himself declared to be critical. There was nothing for
it, however, but implicit obedience; so we bade good-bye to our rueful
friend, and a couple of hours afterwards we were at the station of
Coombe Tracey and had dispatched the trap upon its return journey. A
small boy was waiting upon the platform.

Any orders, sir?

You will take this train to town, Cartwright. The moment you arrive
you will send a wire to Sir Henry Baskerville, in my name, to say that
if he finds the pocket-book which I have dropped he is to send it by
registered post to Baker Street.

Yes, sir.
