There is no connection.

In that case the coincidence must indeed be an extraordinary one. But

one of murder, and the evidence may implicate not only your friend Mr.
Stapleton, but his wife as well. The lady sprang from her chair.

His wife! she cried.

The fact is no longer a secret. The person who has passed for his
sister is really his wife.

Mrs. Lyons had resumed her seat. Her hands were grasping the arms of her

flash of her eyes said more than any words.

I have come prepared to do so, said Holmes, drawing several papers
from his pocket. Here is a photograph of the couple taken in York four
years ago. It is indorsed 'Mr. and Mrs. Vandeleur,' but you will have
no difficulty in recognizing him, and her also, if you know her by
sight. Here are three written descriptions by trustworthy witnesses of
Mr. and Mrs. Vandeleur, who at that time kept St. Oliver's private
school. Read them and see if you can doubt the identity of these
people.
