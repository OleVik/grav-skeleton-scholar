incidents in Godno, in Little Russia, in the year '66, and of course
there are the Anderson murders in North Carolina, but this case
possesses some features which are entirely its own. Even now we have no
clear case against this very wily man. But I shall be very much
surprised if it is not clear enough before we go to bed this night.

The London express came roaring into the station, and a small, wiry
bulldog of a man had sprung from a first-class carriage. We all three
shook hands, and I saw at once from the reverential way in which
Lestrade gazed at my companion that he had learned a good deal since the
days when they had first worked together. I could well remember the
scorn which the theories of the reasoner used then to excite in the
practical man.

Anything good? he asked.

The biggest thing for years, said Holmes. We have two hours before
we need think of starting. I think we might employ it in getting some
dinner and then, Lestrade, we will take the London fog out of your
throat by giving you a breath of the pure night air of Dartmoor. Never
been there? Ah, well, I don't suppose you will forget your first
visit.
