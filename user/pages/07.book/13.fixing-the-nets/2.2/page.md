Not a shadow of one -- only surmise and conjecture. We should be
laughed out of court if we came with such a story and such evidence.

There is Sir Charles's death.

Found dead without a mark upon him. You and I know that he died of
sheer fright, and we know also what frightened him; but how are we to
get twelve stolid jurymen to know it? What signs are there of a hound?
Where are the marks of its fangs? Of course we know that a hound does
not bite a dead body and that Sir Charles was dead before ever the brute
overtook him. But we have to prove all this, and we are not in a
position to do it.

Well, then, to-night?

We are not much better off to-night. Again, there was no direct
connection between the hound and the man's death. We never saw the
hound. We heard it; but we could not prove that it was running upon this
man's trail. There is a complete absence of motive. No, my dear fellow;
we must reconcile ourselves to the fact that we have no case at present,
and that it is worth our while to run any risk in order to establish
one.

And how do you propose to do so?

I have great hopes of what Mrs. Laura Lyons may do for us when the
position of affairs is made clear to her. And I have my own plan as
well. Sufficient for to-morrow is the evil thereof; but I hope before
the day is past to have the upper hand at last.

I could draw nothing further from him, and he walked, lost in thought,
as far as the Baskerville gates.
