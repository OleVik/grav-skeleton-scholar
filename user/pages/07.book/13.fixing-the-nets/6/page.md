Well, I'm glad to hear you say so, said Sir Henry, glancing with
some surprise at my friend. I don't pretend to know much about these
things, and I'd be a better judge of a horse or a steer than of a
picture. I didn't know that you found time for such things.

I know what is good when I see it, and I see it now. That's a
Kneller, I'll swear, that lady in the blue silk over yonder, and the
stout gentleman with the wig ought to be a Reynolds. They are all family
portraits, I presume?

Every one.

Do you know the names?

Barrymore has been coaching me in them, and I think I can say my
lessons fairly well.

Who is the gentleman with the telescope?

That is Rear-Admiral Baskerville, who served under Rodney in the West
Indies. The man with the blue coat and the roll of paper is Sir William
Baskerville, who was Chairman of Committees of the House of Commons
under Pitt.

And this Cavalier opposite to me -- the one with the black velvet and
the lace?

Ah, you have a right to know about him. That is the cause of all the
mischief, the wicked Hugo, who started the Hound of the Baskervilles.
We're not likely to forget him.

I gazed with interest and some surprise upon the portrait.
