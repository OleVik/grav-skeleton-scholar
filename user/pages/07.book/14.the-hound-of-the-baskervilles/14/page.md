Yes.

And the hound?

It is dead.

She gave a long sigh of satisfaction.

Thank God! Thank God! Oh, this villain! See how he has treated me!
She shot her arms out from her sleeves, and we saw with horror that they
were all mottled with bruises. But this is nothing -- nothing! It is my
mind and soul that he has tortured and defiled. I could endure it all,
ill-usage, solitude, a life of deception, everything, as long as I could
still cling to the hope that I had his love, but now I know that in this
also I have been his dupe and his tool. She broke into passionate
sobbing as she spoke.

You bear him no good will, madam, said Holmes. Tell us then where
we shall find him. If you have ever aided him in evil, help us now and
so atone.

There is but one place where he can have fled, she answered. There
is an old tin mine on an island in the heart of the mire. It was there
that he kept his hound and there also he had made preparations so that
he might have a refuge. That is where he would fly.

The fog-bank lay like white wool against the window. Holmes held the
lamp towards it.

See, said he. No one could find his way into the Grimpen Mire
to-night.

She laughed and clapped her hands. Her eyes and teeth gleamed with
fierce merriment.
