The little detective smiled. As long as I have my trousers I have a
hip-pocket, and as long as I have my hip-pocket I have something in
it.

Good! My friend and I are also ready for emergencies.

You're mighty close about this affair, Mr. Holmes. What's the game
now?

A waiting game.

My word, it does not seem a very cheerful place, said the detective
with a shiver, glancing round him at the gloomy slopes of the hill and
at the huge lake of fog which lay over the Grimpen Mire. I see the
lights of a house ahead of us.

That is Merripit House and the end of our journey. I must request you
to walk on tiptoe and not to talk above a whisper.

We moved cautiously along the track as if we were bound for the house,
but Holmes halted us when we were about two hundred yards from it.

This will do, said he. These rocks upon the right make an
admirable screen.

We are to wait here?

Yes, we shall make our little ambush here. Get into this hollow,
Lestrade. You have been inside the house, have you not, Watson? Can you
tell the position of the rooms? What are those latticed windows at this
end?

I think they are the kitchen windows.

And the one beyond, which shines so brightly?
