No.

Where can she be, then, since there is no light in any other room
except the kitchen?

I cannot think where she is.

I have said that over the great Grimpen Mire there hung a dense, white
fog. It was drifting slowly in our direction, and banked itself up like
a wall on that side of us, low, but thick and well defined. The moon
shone on it, and it looked like a great shimmering ice-field, with the
heads of the distant tors as rocks borne upon its surface. Holmes's
face was turned towards it, and he muttered impatiently as he watched
its sluggish drift.

It's moving towards us, Watson.

Is that serious?

Very serious, indeed -- the one thing upon earth which could have
disarranged my plans. He can't be very long, now. It is already ten
o'clock. Our success and even his life may depend upon his coming out
before the fog is over the path.

The night was clear and fine above us. The stars shone cold and bright,
while a half-moon bathed the whole scene in a soft, uncertain light.
Before us lay the dark bulk of the house, its serrated roof and
bristling chimneys hard outlined against the silver-spangled sky. Broad
bars of golden light from the lower windows stretched across the orchard
and the moor. One of them was suddenly shut off. The servants had left
the kitchen. There only remained the lamp in the dining-room where the
two men, the murderous host and the unconscious guest, still chatted
over their cigars.
