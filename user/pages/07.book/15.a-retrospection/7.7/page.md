but she had such a fear of her husband -- a fear founded upon brutal
ill-treatment -- that she dare not write to warn the man whom she knew to
be in danger. If the letter should fall into Stapleton's hands her own
life would not be safe. Eventually, as we know, she adopted the
expedient of cutting out the words which would form the message, and
addressing the letter in a disguised hand. It reached the baronet, and
gave him the first warning of his danger.

It was very essential for Stapleton to get some article of Sir

as no other supposition could explain this anxiety to obtain an old boot
and this indifference to a new one. The more outre and grotesque an
incident is the more carefully it deserves to be examined, and the very

years there have been four considerable burglaries in the West Country,
