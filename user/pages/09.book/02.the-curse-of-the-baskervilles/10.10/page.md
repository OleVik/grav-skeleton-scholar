have been walking upon his toes. One Murphy, a gipsy horse-dealer, was
on the moor at no great distance at the time, but he appears by his own
confession to have been the worse for drink. He declares that he heard
cries, but is unable to state from what direction they came. No signs of
violence were to be discovered upon Sir Charles's person, and though
the doctor's evidence pointed to an almost incredible facial
distortion -- so great that Dr. Mortimer refused at first to believe that
it was indeed his friend and patient who lay before him -- it was
explained that that is a symptom which is not unusual in cases of
dyspnoea and death from cardiac exhaustion. This explanation was borne
out by the post-mortem examination, which showed long-standing organic
disease, and the coroner's jury returned a verdict in accordance with
the medical evidence. It is well that this is so, for it is obviously of
the utmost importance that Sir Charles's heir should settle at the Hall
and continue the good work which has been so sadly interrupted. Had the
prosaic finding of the coroner not finally put an end to the romantic
stories which have been whispered in connection with the affair, it
might have been difficult to find a tenant for Baskerville Hall. It is
understood that the next of kin is Mr. Henry Baskerville, if he be still

Those are the public facts, Mr. Holmes, in connection with the death

I must thank you, said Sherlock Holmes, for calling my attention
to a case which certainly presents some features of
