Such is the tale, my sons, of the coming of the hound which is said to
have plagued the family so sorely ever since. If I have set it down it
is because that which is clearly known hath less terror than that which
is but hinted at and guessed. Nor can it be denied that many of the
family have been unhappy in their deaths, which have been sudden,
bloody, and mysterious. Yet may we shelter ourselves in the infinite
goodness of Providence, which would not forever punish the innocent
beyond that third or fourth generation which is threatened in Holy Writ.
To that Providence, my sons, I hereby commend you, and I counsel you by
way of caution to forbear from crossing the moor in those dark hours
when the powers of evil are exalted.

When Dr. Mortimer had finished reading this singular narrative he pushed
his spectacles up on his forehead and stared across at Mr. Sherlock
Holmes. The latter yawned and tossed the end of his cigarette into the
fire.

Well? said he.

Do you not find it interesting?

To a collector of fairy tales.

Dr. Mortimer drew a folded newspaper out of his pocket.

Now, Mr. Holmes, we will give you something a little more recent. This
is the Devon County Chronicle of May 14th of this year. It is a short
account of the facts elicited at the death of Sir Charles Baskerville
which occurred a few days before that date.
