I confess at these words a shudder passed through me. There was a thrill
in the doctor's voice which showed that he was himself deeply moved by
that which he told us. Holmes leaned forward in his excitement and his
eyes had the hard, dry glitter which shot from them when he was keenly
interested.

You saw this?

As clearly as I see you.

And you said nothing?

What was the use?

How was it that no one else saw it?

The marks were some twenty yards from the body and no one gave them a
thought. I don't suppose I should have done so had I not known this
legend.

There are many sheep-dogs on the moor?

No doubt, but this was no sheep-dog.

You say it was large?

Enormous.

But it had not approached the body?

No.

What sort of night was it?'

Damp and raw.

But not actually raining?

No.
