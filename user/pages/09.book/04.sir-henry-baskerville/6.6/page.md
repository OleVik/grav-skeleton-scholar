negro and your Esquimau. The detection of types is one of the most
elementary branches of knowledge to the special expert in crime, though
I confess that once when I was very young I confused the Leeds Mercury
with the Western Morning News. But a Times leader is entirely
distinctive, and these words could have been taken from nothing else. As
it was done yesterday the strong probability was that we should find the
words in yesterday's issue.

So far as I can follow you, then, Mr. Holmes, said Sir Henry
Baskerville, someone cut out this message with a scissors -- 

Nail-scissors, said Holmes. You can see that it was a very
short-bladed scissors, since the cutter had to take two snips over
'keep away.'

That is so. Someone, then, cut out the message with a pair of
short-bladed scissors, pasted it with paste -- 

Gum, said Holmes.

With gum on to the paper. But I want to know why the word 'moor'
should have been written?

Because he could not find it in print. The other words were all simple
and might be found in any issue, but 'moor' would be less common.

Why, of course, that would explain it. Have you read anything else in
this message, Mr. Holmes?

There are one or two indications, and yet the utmost pains have been
taken to remove all clues. The address, you observe is printed in rough
characters. But the Times is a paper which is seldom found in any hands
but those of the highly educated.
