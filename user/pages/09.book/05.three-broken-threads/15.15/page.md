No, I can't say that.

Nothing more that you can remember?

No, sir; nothing.

Well, then, here is your half-sovereign. There's another one waiting
for you if you can bring any more information. Good night!

Good night, sir, and thank you!

John Clayton departed chuckling, and Holmes turned to me with a shrug of
his shoulders and a rueful smile.

Snap goes our third thread, and we end where we began, said he.
The cunning rascal! He knew our number, knew that Sir Henry
Baskerville had consulted me, spotted who I was in Regent Street,
conjectured that I had got the number of the cab and would lay my hands
on the driver, and so sent back this audacious message. I tell you,
Watson, this time we have got a foeman who is worthy of our steel. I've
been checkmated in London. I can only wish you better luck in
Devonshire. But I'm not easy in my mind about it.

About what?

About sending you. It's an ugly business, Watson, an ugly dangerous
business, and the more I see of it the less I like it. Yes, my dear
fellow, you may laugh, but I give you my word that I shall be very glad
to have you back safe and sound in Baker Street once more.
