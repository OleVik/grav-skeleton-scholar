No, no, said I. Only a humble commoner, but his friend. My name is
Dr. Watson.

A flush of vexation passed over her expressive face. We have been
talking at cross purposes, said she.

Why, you had not very much time for talk, her brother remarked with
the same questioning eyes.

I talked as if Dr. Watson were a resident instead of being merely a
visitor, said she. It cannot much matter to him whether it is early
or late for the orchids. But you will come on, will you not, and see
Merripit House?

A short walk brought us to it, a bleak moorland house, once the farm of
some grazier in the old prosperous days, but now put into repair and
turned into a modern dwelling. An orchard surrounded it, but the trees,
as is usual upon the moor, were stunted and nipped, and the effect of
the whole place was mean and melancholy. We were admitted by a strange,
wizened, rusty-coated old manservant, who seemed in keeping with the
house. Inside, however, there were large rooms furnished with an
elegance in which I seemed to recognize the taste of the lady. As I
looked from their windows at the interminable granite-flecked moor
rolling unbroken to the farthest horizon I could not but marvel at what
could have brought this highly educated man and this beautiful woman to
live in such a place.

Queer spot to choose, is it not? said he as if in answer to my
thought. And yet we manage to make ourselves fairly happy, do we not,
Beryl?

Quite happy, said she, but there was no ring of conviction in her
words.
