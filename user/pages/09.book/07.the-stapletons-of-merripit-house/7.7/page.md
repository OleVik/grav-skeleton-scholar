I assure you that I am simply here upon a visit to my friend, Sir
Henry, and that I need no help of any kind.

Excellent! said Stapleton. You are perfectly right to be wary and
discreet. I am justly reproved for what I feel was an unjustifiable
intrusion, and I promise you that I will not mention the matter again.

We had come to a point where a narrow grassy path struck off from the
road and wound away across the moor. A steep, boulder-sprinkled hill lay
upon the right which had in bygone days been cut into a granite quarry.
The face which was turned towards us formed a dark cliff, with ferns and
brambles growing in its niches. From over a distant rise there floated a
gray plume of smoke.

A moderate walk along this moor-path brings us to Merripit House,
said he. Perhaps you will spare an hour that I may have the pleasure
of introducing you to my sister.

My first thought was that I should be by Sir Henry's side. But then I
remembered the pile of papers and bills with which his study table was
littered. It was certain that I could not help with those. And Holmes
had expressly said that I should study the neighbours upon the moor. I
accepted Stapleton's invitation, and we turned together down the path.

It is a wonderful place, the moor, said he, looking round over the
undulating downs, long green rollers, with crests of jagged granite
foaming up into fantastic surges. You never tire of the moor. You
cannot think the wonderful secrets which it contains. It is so vast, and
so barren, and so mysterious.

You know it well, then?
