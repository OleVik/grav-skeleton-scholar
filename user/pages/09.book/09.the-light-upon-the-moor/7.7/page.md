Yes, I did.

Did he ever strike you as being crazy -- this brother of hers?

I can't say that he ever did.

I dare say not. I always thought him sane enough until to-day, but you
can take it from me that either he or I ought to be in a strait-jacket.
What's the matter with me, anyhow? You've lived near me for some
weeks, Watson. Tell me straight, now! Is there anything that would
prevent me from making a good husband to a woman that I loved?

I should say not.

He can't object to my worldly position, so it must be myself that he
has this down on. What has he against me? I never hurt man or woman in
my life that I know of. And yet he would not so much as let me touch the
tips of her fingers.

Did he say so?

That, and a deal more. I tell you, Watson, I've only known her these
few weeks, but from the first I just felt that she was made for me, and
she, too -- she was happy when she was with me, and that I'll swear.
There's a light in a woman's eyes that speaks louder than words. But
he has never let us get together, and it was only to-day for the first
time that I saw a chance of having a few words with her alone. She was
glad to meet me, but when she did it was not love that she would talk
about, and she wouldn't have let me talk about it either if she could
have stopped it. She kept coming back to it that this was a place of
danger, and that she would never be happy until I had left it. I told
her that since I had seen her I was in no hurry to leave it, and that if
she really wanted me to go, the only way to work it
