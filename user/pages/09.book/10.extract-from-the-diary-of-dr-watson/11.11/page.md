Well, said I, has this precious relation of yours departed, or is
he still lurking out yonder?

I don't know, sir. I hope to heaven that he has gone, for he has
brought nothing but trouble here! I've not heard of him since I left
out food for him last, and that was three days ago.

Did you see him then?

No, sir, but the food was gone when next I went that way.

Then he was certainly there?

So you would think, sir, unless it was the other man who took it.

I sat with my coffee-cup halfway to my lips and stared at Barrymore.

You know that there is another man then?

Yes, sir; there is another man upon the moor.

Have you seen him?

No, sir.

How do you know of him then?

Selden told me of him, sir, a week ago or more. He's in hiding, too,
but he's not a convict as far as I can make out. I don't like it, Dr.
Watson -- I tell you straight, sir, that I don't like it. He spoke
with a sudden passion of earnestness.

Now, listen to me, Barrymore! I have no interest in this matter but
that of your master. I have come here with no object except to help him.
Tell me, frankly, what it is that you don't like.
