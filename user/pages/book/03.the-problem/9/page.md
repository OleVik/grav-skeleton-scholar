I knew that seclusion and solitude were very necessary for my friend in
those hours of intense mental concentration during which he weighed
every particle of evidence, constructed alternative theories, balanced
one against the other, and made up his mind as to which points were
essential and which immaterial. I therefore spent the day at my club and
did not return to Baker Street until evening. It was nearly nine
o'clock when I found myself in the sitting-room once more.

My first impression as I opened the door was that a fire had broken out,
for the room was so filled with smoke that the light of the lamp upon
the table was blurred by it. As I entered, however, my fears were set at
rest, for it was the acrid fumes of strong coarse tobacco which took me
by the throat and set me coughing. Through the haze I had a vague vision
of Holmes in his dressing-gown coiled up in an armchair with his black
clay pipe between his lips. Several rolls of paper lay around him.

Caught cold, Watson? said he.

No, it's this poisonous atmosphere.

I suppose it is pretty thick, now that you mention it.

Thick! It is intolerable.

Open the window, then! You have been at your club all day, I
perceive.

My dear Holmes!

Am I right?

Certainly, but how?

He laughed at my bewildered expression.
