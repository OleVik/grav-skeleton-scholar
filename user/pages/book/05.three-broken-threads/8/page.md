you will forgive the unpleasant hypothesis! -- who would inherit the
estate?

Since Rodger Baskerville, Sir Charles's younger brother died
unmarried, the estate would descend to the Desmonds, who are distant
cousins. James Desmond is an elderly clergyman in Westmoreland.

Thank you. These details are all of great interest. Have you met Mr.
James Desmond?

Yes; he once came down to visit Sir Charles. He is a man of venerable
appearance and of saintly life. I remember that he refused to accept any
settlement from Sir Charles, though he pressed it upon him.

And this man of simple tastes would be the heir to Sir Charles's
thousands.

He would be the heir to the estate because that is entailed. He would
also be the heir to the money unless it were willed otherwise by the
present owner, who can, of course, do what he likes with it.

And have you made your will, Sir Henry?

No, Mr. Holmes, I have not. I've had no time, for it was only
yesterday that I learned how matters stood. But in any case I feel that
the money should go with the title and estate. That was my poor uncle's
idea. How is the owner going to restore the glories of the Baskervilles
if he has not money enough to keep up the property? House, land, and
dollars must go together.

Quite so. Well, Sir Henry, I am of one mind with you as to the
advisability of your going down to Devonshire without delay.
