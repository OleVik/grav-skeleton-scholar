The fresh beauty of the following morning did something to efface from
our minds the grim and gray impression which had been left upon both of
us by our first experience of Baskerville Hall. As Sir Henry and I sat
at breakfast the sunlight flooded in through the high mullioned windows,
throwing watery patches of colour from the coats of arms which covered
them. The dark panelling glowed like bronze in the golden rays, and it
was hard to realize that this was indeed the chamber which had struck
such a gloom into our souls upon the evening before.

I guess it is ourselves and not the house that we have to blame!
said the baronet. We were tired with our journey and chilled by our
drive, so we took a gray view of the place. Now we are fresh and well,
so it is all cheerful once more.

And yet it was not entirely a question of imagination, I answered.
Did you, for example, happen to hear someone, a woman I think, sobbing
in the night?

That is curious, for I did when I was half asleep fancy that I heard
something of the sort. I waited quite a time, but there was no more of
it, so I concluded that it was all a dream.

I heard it distinctly, and I am sure that it was really the sob of a
woman.

We must ask about this right away. He rang the bell and asked
Barrymore whether he could account for our experience. It seemed to me
that the pallid features of the butler turned a shade paler still as he
listened to his master's question.

There are only two women in the house, Sir Henry, he answered. One
is the scullery-maid, who sleeps in the other wing. The other is my
wife, and I can answer for it that the sound could not have come from
her.
