anywhere else until the hue and cry was over, so he lay in hiding there.
But every second night we made sure if he was still there by putting a
light in the window, and if there was an answer my husband took out some
bread and meat to him. Every day we hoped that he was gone, but as long
as he was there we could not desert him. That is the whole truth, as I
am an honest Christian woman, and you will see that if there is blame in
the matter it does not lie with my husband, but with me, for whose sake
he has done all that he has.

The woman's words came with an intense earnestness which carried
conviction with them.

Is this true, Barrymore?

Yes, Sir Henry. Every word of it.

Well, I cannot blame you for standing by your own wife. Forget what I
have said. Go to your room, you two, and we shall talk further about
this matter in the morning.

When they were gone we looked out of the window again. Sir Henry had
flung it open, and the cold night wind beat in upon our faces. Far away
in the black distance there still glowed that one tiny point of yellow
light.

I wonder he dares, said Sir Henry.

It may be so placed as to be only visible from here.

Very likely. How far do you think it is?

Out by the Cleft Tor, I think.

Not more than a mile or two off.

Hardly that.
