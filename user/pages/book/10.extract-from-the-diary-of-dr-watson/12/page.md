Barrymore hesitated for a moment, as if he regretted his outburst, or
found it difficult to express his own feelings in words.

It's all these goings-on, sir, he cried at last, waving his hand
towards the rain-lashed window which faced the moor. There's foul
play somewhere, and there's black villainy brewing, to that I'll
swear! Very glad I should be, sir, to see Sir Henry on his way back to
London again!

But what is it that alarms you?

Look at Sir Charles's death! That was bad enough, for all that the
coroner said. Look at the noises on the moor at night. There's not a
man would cross it after sundown if he was paid for it. Look at this
stranger hiding out yonder, and watching and waiting! What's he waiting
for? What does it mean? It means no good to anyone of the name of
Baskerville, and very glad I shall be to be quit of it all on the day
that Sir Henry's new servants are ready to take over the Hall.

But about this stranger, said I. Can you tell me anything about
him? What did Selden say? Did he find out where he hid, or what he was
doing?

He saw him once or twice, but he is a deep one, and gives nothing
away. At first he thought that he was the police, but soon he found that
he had some lay of his own. A kind of gentleman he was, as far as he
could see, but what he was doing he could not make out.

And where did he say that he lived?

Among the old houses on the hillside -- the stone huts where the old
folk used to live.
