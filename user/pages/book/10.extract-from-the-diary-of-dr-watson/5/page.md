God bless you, sir, and thank you from my heart! It would have killed
my poor wife had he been taken again.

I guess we are aiding and abetting a felony, Watson? But, after what
we have heard I don't feel as if I could give the man up, so there is
an end of it. All right, Barrymore, you can go.

With a few broken words of gratitude the man turned, but he hesitated
and then came back.

You've been so kind to us, sir, that I should like to do the best I
can for you in return. I know something, Sir Henry, and perhaps I should
have said it before, but it was long after the inquest that I found it
out. I've never breathed a word about it yet to mortal man. It's about
poor Sir Charles's death.

The baronet and I were both upon our feet. Do you know how he died?

No, sir, I don't know that.

What then?

I know why he was at the gate at that hour. It was to meet a woman.

To meet a woman! He?

Yes, sir.

And the woman's name?

I can't give you the name, sir, but I can give you the initials. Her
initials were L. L.

How do you know this, Barrymore?
