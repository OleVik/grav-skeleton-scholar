I suggest that we put it in one of the huts until we can communicate
with the police.

Exactly. I have no doubt that you and I could carry it so far. Halloa,
Watson, what's this? It's the man himself, by all that's wonderful
and audacious! Not a word to show your suspicions -- not a word, or my
plans crumble to the ground.

A figure was approaching us over the moor, and I saw the dull red glow
of a cigar. The moon shone upon him, and I could distinguish the dapper
shape and jaunty walk of the naturalist. He stopped when he saw us, and
then came on again.

Why, Dr. Watson, that's not you, is it? You are the last man that I
should have expected to see out on the moor at this time of night. But,
dear me, what's this? Somebody hurt? Not -- don't tell me that it is
our friend Sir Henry! He hurried past me and stooped over the dead
man. I heard a sharp intake of his breath and the cigar fell from his
fingers.

Who -- who's this? he stammered.

It is Selden, the man who escaped from Princetown.

Stapleton turned a ghastly face upon us, but by a supreme effort he had
overcome his amazement and his disappointment. He looked sharply from
Holmes to me.

Dear me! What a very shocking affair! How did he die?

He appears to have broken his neck by falling over these rocks. My
friend and I were strolling on the moor when we heard a cry.

I heard a cry also. That was what brought me out. I was uneasy about
Sir Henry.
